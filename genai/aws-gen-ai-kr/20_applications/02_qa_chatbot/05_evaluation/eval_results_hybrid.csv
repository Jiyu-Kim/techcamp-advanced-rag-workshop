What are the key differences in functionality between Knox Capture in Admin mode versus Managed mode?,"In managed mode, Knox Capture functionality is limited, as end-users cannot make changes to their scanning profiles, export profile settings, or activate a Knox Capture license to switch to Admin mode.","  
Knox Capture functionality is greatly reduced in Managed mode, as compared to Admin mode. Specifically, end-users in Managed mode can:

1. Review their scanning profile settings
2. Perform barcode scans using their business apps (as permitted by their scanning profile)

However, end-users in Managed mode cannot:

1. Make changes to their scanning profiles
2. Export profile settings
3. Switch to Admin mode by activating a Knox Capture license

In contrast, users in Admin mode have full functionality to create and edit scanning profiles, export profile settings, test profiles, and configure all aspects of the app.",1,2,6,0.5,0.9999006986618042,1,0,6.23377251625061,"How do I enforce Managed mode on enterprise devices .

Knox Capture Scandit Edition. About this section Knox Capture Scandit Edition has all of the same functionality as the standard Samsung Knox Capture, however some of the scan engine settings and how licenses are managed differ slightly between the two versions. In this section, you'll find the procedures and workflows that are unique to Knox Capture Scandit Edition. For all other workflows, refer to the main document's how-to guide topics: Create scanning profiles, Configure keystroke output and data formatting, Configure apps and activities, Export and deploy configuration, Set scan trigger, Connect HW scanner, Configure output path, Use scanner overlay, Use test mode, Use intent output

. #Admin mode (Default) When Knox Capture is downloaded from Google Play and installed on a compatible Android device - and a valid license key is activated - the app operates in its default Admin mode. This mode allows the device user - typically an enterprise IT admin - to utilize the full functionality of the app to primarily do the following: 1. Create scanning profiles that define which apps can launch the barcode scanner, which barcode types can be scanned (QR, Code 128, EAN8, etc.), and how scanned data is formatted (append Tab or Enter key, insert special characters before or after data, etc.). 2. Test scanning profiles to ensure that appropriate business apps can launch the scanner and receive data back as keystrokes. 3. Export profile settings as a configuration file, which can then be used by EMM/UEM administrators to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to end-user devices

Overview. Get started with the basics by learning what Knox Capture is and how it works. What is Knox Capture? To help explain what Knox Capture does, it may be helpful to start with an understanding of what a *wedge* scanner is, and how it relates to the Knox Capture solution. In traditional hardware-based barcode scanning terminology, a wedge scanner is a physical device that attaches between a keyboard and a computer. The keyboard attaches to the scanner, and the scanner attaches to the computer. From the computer's perspective, the scanner behaves just like an additional keyboard. When the computer runs a software program (like an inventory spreadsheet app), and barcodes are read using the wedge scanner, data is sent from the scanner to the program in the form of keystrokes. From the program's point of view, data appears exactly as if someone had typed it manually using a keyboard. How Knox Capture works In a similar way, Knox Capture also acts as a wedge between a software program and keyboard. However, instead of being a physical scanning device, Knox Capture is a mobile solution built for compatible Android smartphones and tablets. Enterprise IT admins can either download the Knox Capture app from Google Play, or custom-build their own wedge scanner apps using the Knox Capture SDK (Software Development Kit). Once Knox Capture is installed and running on a device, it *wedges* between an application (for example, a business app used to track inventory) and the mobile device's on-screen keyboard. When an end-user launches their business app, they can simply tap an on-screen button or press a hardware button on their device to trigger a barcode scan using the device's camera. After the camera focuses on a barcode, Knox Capture translates the barcode data into keystrokes, which then get passed back to the business app for processing. From the business app's point of view, keystrokes coming from Knox Capture appear exactly as if a user had typed them from the device keyboard. Who can use Knox Capture? Knox Capture is designed for anyone who wants to turn their mobile device into a powerful barcode scanner. However, depending on whether it's being used by an admin or an end-user, its features vary significantly. #Admin mode (Default) When Knox Capture is downloaded from Google Play and installed on a compatible Android device - and a valid license key is activated - the app operates in its default Admin mode. This mode allows the device user - typically an enterprise IT admin - to utilize the full functionality of the app to primarily do the following: 1. Create scanning profiles that define which apps can launch the barcode scanner, which barcode types can be scanned (QR, Code 128, EAN8, etc.), and how scanned data is formatted (append Tab or Enter key, insert special characters before or after data, etc.). 2. Test scanning profiles to ensure that appropriate business apps can launch the scanner and receive data back as keystrokes. 3. Export profile settings as a configuration file, which can then be used by EMM/UEM administrators to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to end-user devices. #Managed mode After an IT admin uses their EMM/UEM to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to an end-user's device, the device launches the app in Managed mode. In Managed mode, Knox Capture functionality is greatly reduced. End-users can review their scanning profile settings and perform barcode scans using their business apps (as permitted by their scanning profile), however they can't make changes to their scanning profiles, export profile settings, or switch to Admin mode by activating a Knox Capture license.

Overview. Get started with the basics by learning what Knox Capture is and how it works. What is Knox Capture? To help explain what Knox Capture does, it may be helpful to start with an understanding of what a *wedge* scanner is, and how it relates to the Knox Capture solution. In traditional hardware-based barcode scanning terminology, a wedge scanner is a physical device that attaches between a keyboard and a computer. The keyboard attaches to the scanner, and the scanner attaches to the computer. From the computer's perspective, the scanner behaves just like an additional keyboard. When the computer runs a software program (like an inventory spreadsheet app), and barcodes are read using the wedge scanner, data is sent from the scanner to the program in the form of keystrokes. From the program's point of view, data appears exactly as if someone had typed it manually using a keyboard. How Knox Capture works In a similar way, Knox Capture also acts as a wedge between a software program and keyboard",339
What type of configuration settings allow IT admins to append key events after barcode scans in Knox Capture?,Knox Capture includes keystroke output rules that IT admins can use to append key events after a barcode scan.," Since the scanning profile's keystroke output rules define how barcode data gets converted into keystrokes like appending Tab or Enter keys, the relevant part of the context is:

Keystroke output rules - specifying how barcode data gets converted into keystrokes (append Tab or Enter character to each barcode, add prefix or suffix characters, convert output to hex characters, etc.)

The question is:

What type of configuration settings allow IT admins to append key events after barcode scans in Knox Capture?

So the answer is: 

The keystroke output rules in a Knox Capture scanning profile allow IT admins to append key events like Tab or Enter after barcode scans.",0,0,6,0.0,0.9998867511749268,1,0,13.770713567733765,". When using the default scanning profile, IT admins can change the profile's scan engine settings and data processing rules, however they cannot change the default profile's apps and activities behavior. For example, an IT admin can modify the default profile to append a Tab key at the end of each barcode, but they cannot change which apps can trigger the scanner. Custom scanning profiles While the default scanning profile allows Knox Capture to be used right away without any configuration, IT admins may want to use a custom profile to better suit their needs. With a custom profile, IT admins control which apps and activities can trigger a barcode scan. Any apps that you don't select in the custom profile will follow the default behavior in that the barcode scanner is active for all apps not specified in the custom profile. Creating custom scanning profiles Custom profiles can be created by modifying the default profile settings, or by creating entirely new profiles altogether. 1

Scanning profiles. Knox Capture acts as a wedge by translating barcode data into keystrokes that can be sent to a business application. But how does Knox Capture know what barcode types to scan, how to interpret scanned data, and which business applications to pass the data to? For Knox Capture, the *Scanning profile* defines the app's core behavior. A Scanning Profile is a configuration file that gets created or modified by an IT admin using the Knox Capture application. The profile defines how Knox Capture performs a barcode scan, and primarily consists of the following parameters: 1. Apps and activities - define which applications that can launch the Knox Capture scanner. 2. Scanner engine settings - specifying the barcode technologies (QR, Code 128, UPCA, etc.), scanning methods (single barcode, multi barcode), and camera behavior (enable flash, allow camera zoom). 3. Keystroke output rules - specifying how barcode data gets converted into keystrokes (append Tab or Enter character to each barcode, add prefix or suffix characters, convert output to hex characters, etc.) Default scanning profile Out-of-the-box, Knox Capture includes a default scanning profile that gets automatically associated with all apps on the device. In other words, when Knox Capture is launched, *any* app can trigger the camera scanner and receive barcode data in the form of keystrokes. This makes it easy to use Knox Capture for basic scanning purposes without any additional setup. When using the default scanning profile, IT admins can change the profile's scan engine settings and data processing rules, however they cannot change the default profile's apps and activities behavior. For example, an IT admin can modify the default profile to append a Tab key at the end of each barcode, but they cannot change which apps can trigger the scanner. Custom scanning profiles While the default scanning profile allows Knox Capture to be used right away without any configuration, IT admins may want to use a custom profile to better suit their needs. With a custom profile, IT admins control which apps and activities can trigger a barcode scan. Any apps that you don't select in the custom profile will follow the default behavior in that the barcode scanner is active for all apps not specified in the custom profile. Creating custom scanning profiles Custom profiles can be created by modifying the default profile settings, or by creating entirely new profiles altogether. 1. Tap the + button near the top of the app UI to open the profile creation options. 2. Select Create profile to start a profile from scratch, or select Duplicate existing profile to copy the settings from an existing (custom or default) profile. Alternatively, you can create a custom profile by clicking Create profile without clicking the + button. 3. Provide a profile name, then tap Done. The new profile appears in the profiles area below Defult scanning profile.

Scan data is only partially sent to business app. Overview When sending longer barcode data as keystrokes from Knox Capture to a business app, only part of the data can be seen in the business app. Pre-condition This article assumes that the following conditions are met in your Knox Capture scanning profile: 1. Continuous scanning is enabled. This setting is disabled by default. 2. Keystroke output is configured to send scan data as Key events. By default, this value is set to String. Cause When Keystroke data is configured to send as a key event (rather than a string), the processing time is increased. After an internal timer counts down to zero, Knox Capture assumes that all scanned data was delivered successfully to the target field in the business app, and switches the focus back to the scanner overlay. The remaining undelivered data is then sent to the scanner overlay instead of the business app. Resolution In the Knox Capture profile settings, navigate to Keystroke output > Set key event delay and extend the length of time before the foreground focus switches back to the scanner overlay. By default, the key event delay is set to 0 ms. The delay you set occurs between individual key events sent to the business app. For example, when sending scan data that's 10 characters long with a 50 ms key event delay, a 500 ms total delay can be observed.

Out-of-range barcode still scanned successfully by Knox Capture. Overview For example, assuming you've set a symbol count range of 7 - 20 for Code 128 barcodes, the following situations may occur: Code ""1234567"" (length 7) can be successfully scanned. Code ""12345678"" (length 8) can be successfully scanned. Code ""123456"" (length 6) can't be successfully scanned. Code ""12345"" (length 5) can be successfully scanned. This is unexpected behavior. Code ""1234"" (length 4) can't be successfully scanned. Cause When setting the scan length, there's a difference between the number of digits or characters and the active symbol count. The correlation between characters and symbol counts depends on the encoding standard. For instance, Code 128 differs from Code 39. For Code 128, there are three different encoding schemes that can be mixed within a single Code 128 barcode to achieve the shortest possible code. Resolution Check which encoding standards your barcode data follows.

. For example, ""abc"" will appear as ""abc"" in the test overlay. Non-printable ASCII control characters get embedded in curly brackets. For example, a Tab control character will appear as """" in the test overlay if sent as a string. ##Key event Printable and non-printable characters appear in their character representation embedded in angle brackets when sent as key events. For example, if sent as key events, the data `abHT` appears as `` in the test overlay. Example The following example applies test mode notation to scanned barcode data based on a small set of keystroke output rules. Barcode input: `abc\n123\teh` This input uses escape sequences for control characters. `\n` represents Enter and `\t` represents Tab. Keystroke output rules: Send Enter as String, Send Tab as Key event, Send ASCII Printable characters as String Test mode notation: Scanned data: `abc123eh`, Output : `abc123 eh`

. Change this property to include lengths not enabled by default, or to optimize decoding performance for a certain number of symbols. Character-to-symbol mapping depends on barcode type. For example, some barcodes include additional checksum characters in their symbol counts. For more information on active symbol count, refer to Configure the Active Symbol Count. Depends on barcode type. Max. length Determines the maximum supported barcode length (active symbol count) to decode. Depends on barcode type. Inverted color recognition Enables recognition of inverted barcodes that have been printed using bright ink on a dark background. ON/OFF OFF Reduced quiet zone-size Enables scanning codes with smaller than normal quiet zones (white space before and after the code) than allowed by the barcode type specification. Use this if you experience issues when scanning codes that violate quiet zone specifications. Please note that turning on this feature may lead to false positive scans in some cases

. None &mdash; Sends no output for ASCII printable characters. String Key event delay Sets the delay in milliseconds that Knox Capture will wait before sending a key event like Tab.

What intent output information can be obtained from the bundle according to the code snippet?,"The following intent output information can be obtained from the bundle:
- INTENT_OUTPUT_SCAN_SOURCE

3. The unprocessed string data (INTENT_OUTPUT_UNPROCESSED_STRING_DATA)
4. The unprocessed raw data (INTENT_OUTPUT_UNPROCESSED_RAW_DATA)

The intents are sent from Knox Capture to the business app after a successful scan along with the above key information. The code snippet shows how to extract these values from the intent bundle in the business app.",1,1,6,1.0,0.9994277358055115,1,0,10.668301820755005,".INTENT_OUTPUT_SCANNED_BUNDLE_LIST= ""com.samsung.smartscan.scanned_bundle_list"" Value:= bundle list : the scanned barcode data const val INTENT_OUTPUT_UNPROCESSED_RAW_DATA = ""com.samsung.smartscan.unprocessed_raw_data"" const val INTENT_OUTPUT_UNPROCESSED_STRING_DATA = ""com.samsung.smartscan.unprocessed_string_data"" const val INTENT_OUTPUT_SYMBLOGY_TYPE = ""com.samsung.smartscan.symblogy_type"" const val INTENT_OUTPUT_SCAN_SOURCE = ""com.samsung.smartscan.scan_source"" const val INTENT_OUTPUT_SCANNER_TYPE = ""com.samsung.smartscan.scanner_type"" ``` ##The bundle structure ``` const val KEY_SCANNER_TYPE_CAMERA = ""camera"" ``` #Reading the intent output information The following code snippet, written in Kotlin, demonstrates how to get and read the data sent from Knox Capture. ``` fun getAllExtraInfo(intent: Intent):String bundleItem.getString(INTENT_OUTPUT_SCAN_SOURCE)?.let bundleItem.getString(INTENT_OUTPUT_SYMBLOGY_TYPE)?.let bundleItem.getStringArrayList(INTENT_OUTPUT_UNPROCESSED_STRING_DATA)?

Use intent output. If your business app needs to obtain scanned data programmatically (for example, to process it further in-app), Knox Capture can pass the data within an Android intent object instead of through keystroke output. You can also enable intent output to work with keystroke output. For example, if you select Send via startActivity as your intent delivery method, Knox Capture first sends keystrokes to the foreground activity, then sends the intent to the new activity instance. To use Knox Capture's intent output feature: Business app developers must ensure the business app receives the intent, and, IT admins must configure Knox Capture's Intent output feature accordingly. The information in this section is divided into instructions for business app developers and instructions for Knox Capture admins. For business app developers #Edit the AndroidManifest.xml file For your business app to parse the scanned data, you need to set up Knox Capture to send it the correct intent output. To do so, edit AndroidManifest.xml to define the package name, intent action and category. Knox Capture offers three different methods for your app to receive an Android intent. Refer to Intent output settings for more details. The following is a snippet demonstrating the manifest information to edit. Ensure you replace any dummy strings with ones relevant to your app. ``` PackageName = applicationId ""com.test.smartscan"" AndroidManifest.xml ``` If you're using an activity to receive the intent: ``` ``` If you're using the foreground service to receive the intent: ``` ``` If you're using the broadcast receiver to receive the intent: ``` ``` Properly defining the intent filter information ensures that after each successful scan, Knox Capture delivers the intent to your business app through the chosen method. #What's included in the intent output After a successful scan, the configured intent triggers and is sent to the business app along with the following key information. ##Test mode status If Send via startActivity is selected as the intent delivery, test mode can be affected. If test mode is active, the intent is not sent and the business app is not launched. Instead, the following error message appears, notifying you that test mode is active: `Not Start Activity in TestMode!` The key/value pair that signifies test mode status is as follows: ``` Key:= ProfileConstants.KEY_INTENT_TEST_MODE=""intent_in_testmode"" Value:= true/false : whether Knox Capture test mode is on. ``` ##The list of scanned bundles The key/value pair that contains the scanned barcode data is as follows: ``` Key:= ProfileConstants.INTENT_OUTPUT_SCANNED_BUNDLE_LIST= ""com.samsung.smartscan.scanned_bundle_list"" Value:= bundle list : the scanned barcode data const val INTENT_OUTPUT_UNPROCESSED_RAW_DATA = ""com.samsung.smartscan.unprocessed_raw_data"" const val INTENT_OUTPUT_UNPROCESSED_STRING_DATA = ""com.samsung.smartscan.unprocessed_string_data"" const val INTENT_OUTPUT_SYMBLOGY_TYPE = ""com.samsung.smartscan.symblogy_type"" const val INTENT_OUTPUT_SCAN_SOURCE = ""com.samsung.smartscan.scan_source"" const val INTENT_OUTPUT_SCANNER_TYPE = ""com.samsung.smartscan.scanner_type"" ``` ##The bundle structure ``` const val KEY_SCANNER_TYPE_CAMERA = ""camera"" ``` #Reading the intent output information The following code snippet, written in Kotlin, demonstrates how to get and read the data sent from Knox Capture. ``` fun getAllExtraInfo(intent: Intent):String bundleItem.getString(INTENT_OUTPUT_SCAN_SOURCE)?.let bundleItem.getString(INTENT_OUTPUT_SYMBLOGY_TYPE)?.let bundleItem.getStringArrayList(INTENT_OUTPUT_UNPROCESSED_STRING_DATA)?.let }, \n"") } bundleItem.getByteArray(INTENT_OUTPUT_UNPROCESSED_RAW_DATA)?.let "") } sb.append(""]"") } sb.append(""}"") } return sb.toString() } ``` #Knox Capture configuration You must instruct the IT admin to configure the same package and intent delivery method as specified in the AndroidManifest.xml file.

Intent category - Sets the category of the intent action. Intent delivery - Selects one of three delivery methods for intent-based data: 1. Send via startActivity - Launches the activity to pass data through. 2. Send via startForeground - Creates a foreground service from an activity or app component to pass data through. This option is only available for devices running Android 8 and above. 3. Broadcast Intent - Gives the business app's broadcast receiver foreground priority on the device to speed up data delivery. Use this delivery method only if you're experiencing delays when sending scanned data immediately after the device is booted. After you configure an Android intent, the intent delivery method is added to the blue test overlay in Test mode. Refer to Use test mode for steps on how to check your configuration.

Intent output settings Refer to the following settings to configure an Android intent: The intent action and category must match the ones defined in your business app's `AndroidManifest.xml` file, under a component's `intent-filter` element. For detailed instructions, contact the developers of the app. Application package name - Selects one or more apps to receive the intent. Intent action - Designates an action to handle the intent. Intent category - Sets the category of the intent action. Intent delivery - Selects one of three delivery methods for intent-based data: 1. Send via startActivity - Launches the activity to pass data through. 2. Send via startForeground - Creates a foreground service from an activity or app component to pass data through. This option is only available for devices running Android 8 and above. 3. Broadcast Intent - Gives the business app's broadcast receiver foreground priority on the device to speed up data delivery. Use this delivery method only if you're experiencing delays when sending scanned data immediately after the device is booted. After you configure an Android intent, the intent delivery method is added to the blue test overlay in Test mode. Refer to Use test mode for steps on how to check your configuration.

Use intent output. If your business app needs to obtain scanned data programmatically (for example, to process it further in-app), Knox Capture can pass the data within an Android intent object instead of through keystroke output. You can also enable intent output to work with keystroke output. For example, if you select Send via startActivity as your intent delivery method, Knox Capture first sends keystrokes to the foreground activity, then sends the intent to the new activity instance. To use Knox Capture's intent output feature: Business app developers must ensure the business app receives the intent, and, IT admins must configure Knox Capture's Intent output feature accordingly. The information in this section is divided into instructions for business app developers and instructions for Knox Capture admins. For business app developers #Edit the AndroidManifest.xml file For your business app to parse the scanned data, you need to set up Knox Capture to send it the correct intent output

For business app developers #Edit the AndroidManifest.xml file For your business app to parse the scanned data, you need to set up Knox Capture to send it the correct intent output. To do so, edit AndroidManifest.xml to define the package name, intent action and category. Knox Capture offers three different methods for your app to receive an Android intent. Refer to Intent output settings for more details. The following is a snippet demonstrating the manifest information to edit. Ensure you replace any dummy strings with ones relevant to your app. ``` PackageName = applicationId ""com.test.smartscan"" AndroidManifest.xml ``` If you're using an activity to receive the intent: ``` ``` If you're using the foreground service to receive the intent: ``` ``` If you're using the broadcast receiver to receive the intent: ``` ``` Properly defining the intent filter information ensures that after each successful scan, Knox Capture delivers the intent to your business app through the chosen method. #What's included in the intent output After a successful scan, the configured intent triggers and is sent to the business app along with the following key information. ##Test mode status If Send via startActivity is selected as the intent delivery, test mode can be affected. If test mode is active, the intent is not sent and the business app is not launched. Instead, the following error message appears, notifying you that test mode is active: `Not Start Activity in TestMode!` The key/value pair that signifies test mode status is as follows: ``` Key:= ProfileConstants.KEY_INTENT_TEST_MODE=""intent_in_testmode"" Value:= true/false : whether Knox Capture test mode is on. ``` ##The list of scanned bundles The key/value pair that contains the scanned barcode data is as follows: ``` Key:= ProfileConstants.INTENT_OUTPUT_SCANNED_BUNDLE_LIST= ""com.samsung.smartscan.scanned_bundle_list"" Value:= bundle list : the scanned barcode data const val INTENT_OUTPUT_UNPROCESSED_RAW_DATA = ""com.samsung.smartscan.unprocessed_raw_data"" const val INTENT_OUTPUT_UNPROCESSED_STRING_DATA = ""com.samsung.smartscan.unprocessed_string_data"" const val INTENT_OUTPUT_SYMBLOGY_TYPE = ""com.samsung.smartscan.symblogy_type"" const val INTENT_OUTPUT_SCAN_SOURCE = ""com.samsung.smartscan.scan_source"" const val INTENT_OUTPUT_SCANNER_TYPE = ""com.samsung.smartscan.scanner_type"" ``` ##The bundle structure ``` const val KEY_SCANNER_TYPE_CAMERA = ""camera"" ``` #Reading the intent output information The following code snippet, written in Kotlin, demonstrates how to get and read the data sent from Knox Capture. ``` fun getAllExtraInfo(intent: Intent):String bundleItem.getString(INTENT_OUTPUT_SCAN_SOURCE)?.let bundleItem.getString(INTENT_OUTPUT_SYMBLOGY_TYPE)?.let bundleItem.getStringArrayList(INTENT_OUTPUT_UNPROCESSED_STRING_DATA)?.let }, \n"") } bundleItem.getByteArray(INTENT_OUTPUT_UNPROCESSED_RAW_DATA)?.let "") } sb.append(""]"") } sb.append(""}"") } return sb.toString() } ``` #Knox Capture configuration You must instruct the IT admin to configure the same package and intent delivery method as specified in the AndroidManifest.xml file.

Step 7: Deploy Knox Capture using an EMM/UEM You have now configured a basic Knox Capture configuration and exported it as an email attachment. The only thing left to do is use the configuration to deploy Knox Capture as a managed-app to your end-users. Actual deployment steps vary depending on the EMM provider, but they should generally resemble the following: 1. Add the Knox Capture app to your Managed Google Play Store. 2. Assign the app to a group or organization and launch the app configuration dialog. In a typical console, the app configuration dialog opens as a pop-up window or modal. 3. Activate the license by pasting it into the field within the app configuration (App Config) screen. 4. Copy and paste the exported configuration into the provided app configuration field. Adding a configuration to Managed Google Play is the only step necessary to ensure all devices installing the app operate in Managed mode. However, if you're using a trial version of Knox Capture, you'll need to push a Knox Suite license key as well. Refer to the following table for details on the configuration data: Configuration key , Configuration type , Configuration value - , - , - smartscan_license , String , Knox license key smartscan_config , String , Exported configuration data from Knox Capture 5. Save the updated settings and deploy. Summary You have now completed a typical Knox Capture workflow for IT admins, and have been introduced to configuring and deploying the app to managed devices.

Overview. Get started with the basics by learning what Knox Capture is and how it works. What is Knox Capture? To help explain what Knox Capture does, it may be helpful to start with an understanding of what a *wedge* scanner is, and how it relates to the Knox Capture solution. In traditional hardware-based barcode scanning terminology, a wedge scanner is a physical device that attaches between a keyboard and a computer. The keyboard attaches to the scanner, and the scanner attaches to the computer. From the computer's perspective, the scanner behaves just like an additional keyboard. When the computer runs a software program (like an inventory spreadsheet app), and barcodes are read using the wedge scanner, data is sent from the scanner to the program in the form of keystrokes. From the program's point of view, data appears exactly as if someone had typed it manually using a keyboard. How Knox Capture works In a similar way, Knox Capture also acts as a wedge between a software program and keyboard

. #Character representation , Printable ASCII or Unicode characters are represented in their native printable format. For example, ""abc123"" appears as ""abc123"" in the test overlay. Non-printable ASCII control characters are represented with standard abbreviation. For example, a Tab control character appears as ""HT"" in the test overlay

. For example, ""abc"" will appear as ""abc"" in the test overlay. Non-printable ASCII control characters get embedded in curly brackets. For example, a Tab control character will appear as """" in the test overlay if sent as a string. ##Key event Printable and non-printable characters appear in their character representation embedded in angle brackets when sent as key events. For example, if sent as key events, the data `abHT` appears as `` in the test overlay. Example The following example applies test mode notation to scanned barcode data based on a small set of keystroke output rules. Barcode input: `abc\n123\teh` This input uses escape sequences for control characters. `\n` represents Enter and `\t` represents Tab. Keystroke output rules: Send Enter as String, Send Tab as Key event, Send ASCII Printable characters as String Test mode notation: Scanned data: `abc123eh`, Output : `abc123 eh`",226
Describe an example use case for the search-and-find AR template. What problem does it help solve?,This AR template can help a retail worker locate a single box from a large wall of boxes in a warehouse. It analyzes each barcode in the camera preview window and overlays a match on the worker's screen for easy identification.," The search-and-find AR template helps users locate a specific barcode from a group of similar barcodes. An example use case is a retail worker trying to find one box out of many similar boxes on a warehouse shelf. The worker scans a reference barcode for the item they need to find. Then when they point their camera at the shelf, the AR overlay analyzes the barcodes in view and highlights the one that matches the reference, helping the worker quickly locate the correct item. This solves the problem of having to visually search through many similar items to find the one you need.",1,1,6,1.0,0.998323380947113,1,0,6.633221864700317,". #Search-and-find templates This AR template provides an overlay to help users locate and isolate a single barcode when several similar barcodes are in the camera preview window. For example, a retail worker may be asked to locate a single box from a large wall of boxes in a warehouse. Using Knox Capture AR, the worker can start by scanning a reference barcode of the item they're searching for. After the reference barcode is scanned, the worker simply needs to point their camera at the wall of boxes in the warehouse. Knox Capture AR then analyzes each barcode in view, looking for a match. When a match is found, the AR overlay highlights the barcode, and additional product information is provided to the worker for review. #View-and-update templates This AR template provides an overlay to allow users to view product information and make real-time updates to a product database whenever a barcode is scanned

Configure AR. Refer to the following instructions for creating Knox Capture AR templates. Configure Search-and-find template To create an AR template that allows users to search for a reference barcode: 1. Tap the menu button (three vertical dots) next to the search icon on the Knox Capture home screen, then select Augmented reality > Configure AR. 2. On the template selection screen, tap Search and find. 3. In AR overlay settings, give your template a name and provide an _optional_ Template URL. The Template URL field is used if you want to connect Knox Capture AR to you product database in order to display additional product information whenever a reference barcode is located. See Connecting AR to a database server for more information. 4. In Barcode types, select the barcode technologies that you want Knox Capture AR to scan. 5. Tap Continue to save your template. If you entered a database server address in the Tempalte URL field, you'll be taken to the AR overlay field selection screen

AR overview. The Knox Capture AR (Augmented Reality) is a feature that allows users to view important, business-critical information on the device screen when peforming a barcode scan. Normally, whenever a user launches the scanner, aims their camera at one or more barcodes, and captures the barcode data, Knox Capture simply passes the barcode information back to the business-app for review for the user to review. There is no way for the user to interact with any of the information until it reaches the business-app. To some organizations, scanning several barcodes and reviewing the data only _after_ it reaches the business-app can be inefficient, especially if the information isn't what they were looking for in the first place. This could lead to re-scans and additional worker overhead in order to capture the proper data. When a user triggers a barcode scan using Knox Capture AR, the camera preview window gets augmented with a customizable overlay that allows the user to view, analyze, and interact with the barcode data in real-time. For example, a retail worker using AR to scan an item could view information like the product's model number, sale price, or remaining inventory count, all from within the camera preview window, without ever having to open their business app to review the data. About AR templates Just like how scanning profiles define core Knox Capture behavior like which apps can trigger a scan, which barcodes are accepted, and what happens to data after it gets captured, AR templates also define the characteristics and behaviors of the Knox Capture AR feature. #Search-and-find templates This AR template provides an overlay to help users locate and isolate a single barcode when several similar barcodes are in the camera preview window. For example, a retail worker may be asked to locate a single box from a large wall of boxes in a warehouse.

After the reference barcode is scanned, the worker simply needs to point their camera at the wall of boxes in the warehouse. Knox Capture AR then analyzes each barcode in view, looking for a match.

Out-of-range barcode still scanned successfully by Knox Capture. Overview For example, assuming you've set a symbol count range of 7 - 20 for Code 128 barcodes, the following situations may occur: Code ""1234567"" (length 7) can be successfully scanned. Code ""12345678"" (length 8) can be successfully scanned. Code ""123456"" (length 6) can't be successfully scanned. Code ""12345"" (length 5) can be successfully scanned. This is unexpected behavior. Code ""1234"" (length 4) can't be successfully scanned. Cause When setting the scan length, there's a difference between the number of digits or characters and the active symbol count. The correlation between characters and symbol counts depends on the encoding standard. For instance, Code 128 differs from Code 39. For Code 128, there are three different encoding schemes that can be mixed within a single Code 128 barcode to achieve the shortest possible code. Resolution Check which encoding standards your barcode data follows.

What barcode type typically has optional checksums that can be enforced to help reduce false positives and provide an extra layer of error prevention?,"Some barcode types include a mandatory checksum, while others only have optional checksums. Enforcing an optional checksum helps reduce false positives and provides an extra layer of error prevention."," The key paragraphs from the context that provide relevant information to answer this question are:

Enforcing an optional checksum helps reduce false positives and provides an extra layer of error prevention. When enabling a checksum, ensure your barcode data includes the calculated checksum, otherwise the checksum will not match and the barcode data is discarded.""

Therefore, the barcode types that typically have optional checksums that can be enforced to help reduce false positives and provide an extra layer of error prevention are those that support a checksum mod n setting. These barcode types allow an optional modulo n checksum to be enabled. Enabling this checksum provides the benefits described of reducing false positives and adding error prevention to the barcode scanning.",1,1,6,1.0,0.9999159574508667,1,0,19.219647645950317,".

Knox Capture v1.2 release notes. This Knox Capture v1.2 release, scheduled to go live on July 30, 2021, includes several new features and improvements to existing functionality. Starting with Knox Capture v1.2, devices running an Android version lower than 11 (R) are not supported. On these devices, downloading Knox Capture from the Google Play store installs v1.1 instead. All customers should upgrade devices to Android 11 (R) OS binary before v1.2 can be downloaded. Expanded device support In Knox Capture v1.2, support is added for the following devices: Galaxy XCover 4S, Galaxy Tab Active Pro, Galaxy S20, Galaxy S21 Only the keyboard scan icon and floating scan button are supported on non-rugged devices (S20 and S21). For a full list of supported devices, see Supported devices. Keystroke output support in WP-C deployments In previous Knox Capture versions, if an IT admin activated a KPE Premium license with a WP-C deployment, remote injection was blocked in WP-C mode

Knox Capture v1.4 release notes. Support for additional non-rugged Samsung devices With Knox Capture v1.4, all Samsung devices running the ""Android - Secured by Knox"" platform and Android 12 or higher are supported. IMPORTANT - Due to hardware limitations, devices running the Legacy One UI Core platform are unsupported. Please refer to the Knox Capture supported devices list to verify whether your device model is supported. Enhanced performance for single scans With this release, single scan performance and camera launch times are improved across all supported devices. The number of single barcodes device users can scan per minute is significantly increased, and the camera scanner launches much faster. Added side key double press scan trigger Expanding the camera scan trigger options, IT admins and device users can now choose to launch the Knox Capture device scanner by pressing the side key, formerly known as the power or Bixby button, twice. This trigger option is designed for devices without an XCover key, and aims to improve Knox Capture usability for non-rugged devices. To learn more about the available trigger options and how to configure them, see Set the camera scan trigger. Added feature to send output data to a PC through Bluetooth Starting with v1.4, IT admins and device users can connect a Knox Capture-enabled device to a PC or other Bluetooth-enabled device. The device acts as a Human Interface Device (HID) keyboard when connected to a PC, emulating the functionality of a hardware scanner. For more information, see Configure the output path. New camera toggle option on scanning preview screen A camera toggle button is now available when the Knox Capture camera preview opens. Device users can tap the button to switch between the front-facing and rear cameras on the device, enhancing their scanning output and productivity. Usability improvements to in-app web links Previously, tapping on any link in the Knox Capture app opened it in the device's default browser. The app switching caused workflow disruptions and prevented users from quickly locating the information they needed. In v1.4, all in-app web links open in a web view instead of the browser, providing a seamless experience for users accessing support materials through the app. Back to release notes

Knox Capture v1.3 release notes. Expanded non-rugged device support This Knox Capture release adds support for the following Samsung devices: Galaxy A32, Galaxy A32 5G, Galaxy A52, Galaxy A52 5G, Galaxy A52s 5G For a full device list, see Supported devices. New license deactivation methods Knox Capture v1.3 introduces three new ways to deactivate a license. You can trigger license deactivation by uninstalling the Knox Capture app, modifying the License field within your EMM's app configuration screen, or by entering the associated device's IMEI in your Knox dashboard. Knox Capture license seats are also automatically released after 180 days of device inactivity, ensuring that any seats associated with lost or unused devices can be reused. For detailed steps on each deactivation method, refer to Deactivate a license. Updated toast message behavior after Knox Capture scan trigge Previously, when a device user tried to initiate a Knox Capture scan with a hardware or software trigger and there was no Knox Capture profile associated with the app activity, the following toast message appeared: [Package name] doesn't support Knox Capture scan This message appeared most frequently in system apps. Starting from v1.3, Knox Capture supports scanning for all system apps. If there is no Knox Capture profile for the app activity, the toast message no longer appears after the device user activates one of the Knox Capture trigger buttons. This behavior applies to both the device camera and any peripheral hardware scanners attached to the device. Support for system apps in scanning profile creation Prior to Knox Capture v1.3, only 3 system apps were allowlisted when selecting apps for scanning profile creation: Samsung Internet, Google Chrome, and Samsung Messages. With this release, you can now select system apps in addition to downloaded apps when creating a profile. On the app selection screen, tap the filter icon and choose to filter the app list by Downloaded apps, System apps, or All. !System apps menu Scanning engine improvements Knox Capture v1.3 adds the following scanning engine and performance enhancements: 1D barcodes with 1px bars are now recognized more easily. Barcodes inside bitmaps can now be scanned. Barcode image localization is improved in difficult scanning situations, depending on the device or symbologies involved. Back to release notes

What new capability does Knox Capture v1.1 add to support sending scan data to business apps?,"Knox Capture v1.1 adds support for intent output, which allows the scan data to be sent programmatically to a business app when triggered by an Android intent.","

Knox Capture v1.1 adds Advanced data formatting. This allows custom rules to be configured to trigger or block actions based on a set of criteria. For example, rules can be set to send only part of the barcode data (such as the last 4 digits) to the business app.",1,1,6,1.0,0.9291725754737854,0,0,6.6976494789123535,"Knox Capture v1.1 release notes. Landscape mode support With this new update, Knox Capture can now be used in landscape mode on all supported devices. Frontline workers can choose to scan barcodes or navigate the app UI in either portrait or landscape mode, allowing more robust scan capability. Added device model support Extending Knox Capture's device lineup, the Galaxy XCover 5 has been added to the list of supported devices in v1.1. Advanced data formatting With v1.1, custom rules can be configured to trigger or block actions based on a set of criteria. Advanced data formatting allows you to move the cursor, modify, send, or delay data sent to an input field. For example, you can create a rule to send only the last 4 digits of a barcode to a business app. For more information, refer to Advanced data formatting. Keyboard scan button input method A scan button has been added to the device keyboard that launches the Knox Capture camera for scanning. On devices running OneUI 2.1, the scan button is added to the last position on the keyboard toolbar. On devices with OneUI 2.5 and above, installing Knox Capture adds the scan button to the first position on the keyboard toolbar by default. In both cases, you can drag and drop the button to change its position. If a device was upgraded to OneUI 2.5 or above after installing Knox Capture, the scan button remains in the same position on the keyboard as it was before the upgrade. Pinch-to-zoom gestures for scanning When scanning barcodes using Knox Capture, users can now use pinch gestures to increase or decrease the scan range up to a maximum of 4x resolution. In single-scan mode, the capture screen resets to the original zoom factor after each scan. In multi-scan mode, the screen remains zoomed in or out for the remainder of the scan session. Intent output Knox Capture v1.1 adds support for intent output. As an IT admin, you can configure scan data to be sent programmatically to a business app when triggered by an Android intent. Upon scanning, the app acquires the data and can either consume or process it further. Refer to Intent output for more details. WP-C mode support Knox Capture is now compatible with work profile on company owned devices (WP-C), which is replacing fully managed devices with a work profile in Android 11. In WP-C mode, Knox Capture supports business apps installed in the same device area - for example, if both Knox Capture and the business app are inside the work profile. Nearby Share support Starting from Android 10, NFC is deprecated and replaced with Nearby Share to enhance user privacy. Knox Capture v1.1 supports importing and exporting profile configurations using Nearby Share, allowing you to quickly share configurations with devices in your proximity. Back to release notes

Knox Capture v1.5 release notes. Scanner overlay Starting with Knox Capture v1.5, a scanner overlay is available. This overlay appears as a scanner preview over business apps, and enables device users to immediately see scanned data entered into an app field. Functionally, the scanner overlay works much like the full-screen scanner. When the device user aims the camera at the barcode, Knox Capture then sends the scanned data to the business app depending on whether single scan or multi-scan mode is enabled, and how Barcode selection is configured. See Use the scanner overlay to learn more. Continuous scanning for single scan mode Previously, when device users scanned single barcodes, the camera preview turned on before each scan, then off again once the scan was completed. Now, in Single scan preferences, you can turn on Continuous scanning to scan back-to-back barcodes without relaunching the camera preview after every scan. This feature maximizes worker efficiency when used with a Bluetooth wedge or the scanner overlay. Improvements to configuration behavior after profile mode change With this release, if a Knox Capture profile is pushed to a device in Admin mode through a UEM, the device enters Managed mode and removes any configurations previously applied in Admin mode. For example, consider a device user who's conducting practice scans in Admin mode. Upon receiving a profile configuration, a notification on the device confirms that the configuration updated, and Knox Capture automatically turns off test mode and clears the test results. PDF417 barcode support for default profiles Starting with Knox Capture v1.5, default profiles now include the PDF417 barcode type. The current barcode symbologies enabled in the default profile are: Code 128, QR, Code 39, EAN8, EAN13/UPCA, UPCE, Interleaved 2 of 5, Data Matrix, PDF417 Back to release notes

Knox Capture v1.8 release notes. New features Knox Capture v1.8 introduces the following new features: #Continuous single scan A new Continuous scanning option appears on the Scan engine settings > Single scan preferences screen. When this option is toggled On, device users can scan several barcodes in sequence - and have each scan be registered as a single event - without having to press the camera trigger button between each scan. To learn more about the Continuous scanning feature, see Single scan preferences. #Scanner overlay In this release, device users have the option to view the camera preview window as an overlay on top of their business app. When the Scanner overlay feature is enabled and a scan is triggered, users will see a mini camera preview window on top of their existing business app screen. To learn more about this new feature, see Scanner overlay. #Inverse color barcode support This release adds a new Performance lab feature that allows users to scan inverse colored barcodes. This feature only works with Data Matrix and QR type barcodes in this release. To enable this option, go to the Knox Capture main screen, then tap the Options button (three dots), tap Performance lab, then enable Inverted color recognition. Enhancements Knox Capture v1.8 includes the following enhancements to existing features: #More intuitive user prompts when connecting USB device Previously, users would get a prompt even if Knox Capture wasn't running in the foreground. For example, a user might want to connect a USB keyboard for use in their business. When connecting the keyboard, they would see a prompt asking if they wanted to use the USB keyboard for scanning purposes, even though they may not be using Knox Capture at the time. This release improves the prompt so that it only shows when Knox Capture is being used in the foreground. The device user must grant system permissions for connected devices in order for the prompt to display. If no permissions are granted, the prompt will not display on any screen. #Seamlessly switch between multiple paired devices in Output path If a user is paired with multiple devices in Knox Capture's Output path, they can now switch between each of their paired devices more easily. Previously, if a user had two paired devices in Output path, and Knox Capture was connected to _device A_, the user would first have to disconnect from _device A_ before connecting to _device B_. With this release, the user simply has to connect to _device B_. Knox Capture automatically disconnects from any previously paired devices. #Receive a notification when overlay is restricted by IT admin Some device users may experience an issue where they are unable to view the camera preview window after triggering a scan. This issue can be caused by a restriction set by the IT admin and the organization's UEM policy. Previously, if the restriction was set, the user would simply not be able to see the preview window. In this release, the user will now get a notification asking them to contact their IT admin for more information. To learn more about the restriction, see the Knox Capture Knowledge Base Article (KBA) related to this issue. Back to release notes

Knox Capture v1.2 release notes. This Knox Capture v1.2 release, scheduled to go live on July 30, 2021, includes several new features and improvements to existing functionality. Starting with Knox Capture v1.2, devices running an Android version lower than 11 (R) are not supported. On these devices, downloading Knox Capture from the Google Play store installs v1.1 instead. All customers should upgrade devices to Android 11 (R) OS binary before v1.2 can be downloaded. Expanded device support In Knox Capture v1.2, support is added for the following devices: Galaxy XCover 4S, Galaxy Tab Active Pro, Galaxy S20, Galaxy S21 Only the keyboard scan icon and floating scan button are supported on non-rugged devices (S20 and S21). For a full list of supported devices, see Supported devices. Keystroke output support in WP-C deployments In previous Knox Capture versions, if an IT admin activated a KPE Premium license with a WP-C deployment, remote injection was blocked in WP-C mode. As a workaround, `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` must be set to True to support keystroke output. With this release, keystroke output in WP-C deployments is supported regardless of whether `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` is set to True. Keystroke output support is not yet available for Galaxy S20 devices. You must use the aforementioned workaround to use keystroke output on Galaxy S20 devices. Option to disable default profile IT admins can now enable or disable the default profile. If you create profiles for several applications and don't want the default profile's behavior to override any configurations, set the default profile to Off. The default profile setting is available on the Knox Capture main page. You can change the configuration at any time, export and deploy it to end users in Managed mode. If a profile is not active for an app or foreground activity and the end user attempts to scan a barcode, an error message is shown stating that the application does not support Knox Capture scanning. This setting cannot be changed in Managed mode. New floating button scan trigger !Hardware scan trigger setting !Hardware scan trigger setting A floating scan button is now available that launches the Knox Capture camera for scanning. By default, the scan button appears in the bottom right corner of the device's screen. Users can move it around the screen, and it remains in the last known position until it's toggled off. The scan button can be used in both Admin and Managed modes. See Set camera trigger for more information on the various available triggers. License activation menu for unmanaged devices Previously, Knox Capture licenses could only be used by organizations pushing them through an MDM. Starting from Knox Capture v1.2, IT admins can now activate Knox Capture licenses in-app using the new license activation menu. To deactivate an entered license key, uninstall the Knox Capture app from your device. The license activation menu is only available in Admin mode. For more information, see Activate your license. Support for exporting large configurations through QR code !Multiple QR code export This Knox Capture version extends the QR code export functionality to support larger configurations. Prior to v1.2, IT admins couldn't select QR code as the export method if the configuration size was too large. Now, multiple QR codes are generated in a PDF file for the end user to scan. The device prompts the user to scan them all before the configuration can be successfully imported to Knox Capture. To learn more, see Export a scanning configuration and Import a scanning configuration. Persistent scan sessions IT admins and end users can now pick up calls, switch apps, and clear tasks during scan sessions without losing scanned data. Rebooting the device has no impact on saved scan data. In multi-scan sessions where the user leaves the business app and returns, they are prompted to either continue the original scan session or begin a new one

Scanning overlay doesn't appear when launching the camera. Overview Some device users experience an issue where they are unable to view the scanner overlay after launching the device's camera for use as a scanner. Cause The issue occurs when the Android Enterprise policy that controls the DISALLOW_CREATE_WINDOWS boolean sets it to true. This boolean specifies whether or not apps can open secondary windows. By default, the value of this boolean is false, allowing apps like Knox Capture to create a window for the scanner overlay every time the camera launches. If a device policy sets this boolean to true, then Knox Capture won't be able to create the scanner overlay window when the camera launches. Resolution Ensure that the policy in your UEM profile that controls this value sets it to the equivalent of false. For Knox Manage customers, set the Create Window policy to Allow. For all other UEMs, refer to their documentation on Android Enterprise policies.

Policy or license updates not applied to Knox Capture app. Overview You may encounter an issue where policy or license updates that you push aren't applied to a device's Knox Capture app. Cause If the device is already running Knox Capture when you push policy or license updates, the changes can't be applied until the app is relaunched. Resolution Restart the Knox Capture app on the device.

. Once the IT admin has configured the profile, they push it to enterprise devices through their EMM. Device users can then start using the business app to scan barcodes.

. #Admin mode (Default) When Knox Capture is downloaded from Google Play and installed on a compatible Android device - and a valid license key is activated - the app operates in its default Admin mode. This mode allows the device user - typically an enterprise IT admin - to utilize the full functionality of the app to primarily do the following: 1. Create scanning profiles that define which apps can launch the barcode scanner, which barcode types can be scanned (QR, Code 128, EAN8, etc.), and how scanned data is formatted (append Tab or Enter key, insert special characters before or after data, etc.). 2. Test scanning profiles to ensure that appropriate business apps can launch the scanner and receive data back as keystrokes. 3. Export profile settings as a configuration file, which can then be used by EMM/UEM administrators to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to end-user devices

. 3. Assign the app to a group or organization and launch the app configuration dialog. In most consoles, the app configuration (or App Config) dialog opens as a pop-up window or modal. 4. Activate your license in the EMM. 5. Copy and paste the text of the exported Knox Capture configuration into the provided configuration field. 6. Save the updated settings and deploy. If you do not add a configuration for Knox Capture in Managed Google Play when updating a license key, the app operates according to its _previous_ configuration. For example, a device with an existing scan configuration will continue to operate in Managed mode after updating the license key. However, a new device without an existing configuration will operate in Admin mode. To ensure _all_ devices operate in Managed mode, prepare and include the configuration each time you add or modify the app within the EMM console",316

What are some common reasons why barcode data may not output correctly to a business app?,Most barcode capture issues begin with minor errors in the keystroke output and scan engine settings.,"

Some common reasons why barcode data may not output correctly to a business app include:

- Minor errors in the keystroke output and scan engine settings. Using test mode can help verify configurations after setting up a profile.

- The barcode type encoding standard not matching the character-to-symbol mapping configuration. For example, Code 128 uses three different encoding schemes that can be mixed, so the symbol count may differ from the character count.

- Scanning barcodes that violate the quiet zone specifications, if reduced quiet zone size recognition is not enabled. 

- Using tiny barcodes that Knox Capture has difficulty scanning, especially Code 93 and Code 128 types. It's recommended to avoid using very small barcodes.",1,1,6,1.0,0.9809619784355164,1,0,19.772611141204834,"Barcode capture not working for business app. Overview You may encounter situations where barcode data is not outputting correctly to your business app. Why isn't barcode capture working for my business app? Most barcode capture issues begin with minor errors in the keystroke output and scan engine settings. Try using test mode to verify your configurations after setting up a profile.

Out-of-range barcode still scanned successfully by Knox Capture. Overview For example, assuming you've set a symbol count range of 7 - 20 for Code 128 barcodes, the following situations may occur: Code ""1234567"" (length 7) can be successfully scanned. Code ""12345678"" (length 8) can be successfully scanned. Code ""123456"" (length 6) can't be successfully scanned. Code ""12345"" (length 5) can be successfully scanned. This is unexpected behavior. Code ""1234"" (length 4) can't be successfully scanned. Cause When setting the scan length, there's a difference between the number of digits or characters and the active symbol count. The correlation between characters and symbol counts depends on the encoding standard. For instance, Code 128 differs from Code 39. For Code 128, there are three different encoding schemes that can be mixed within a single Code 128 barcode to achieve the shortest possible code. Resolution Check which encoding standards your barcode data follows.

. Change this property to include lengths not enabled by default, or to optimize decoding performance for a certain number of symbols. Character-to-symbol mapping depends on barcode type. For example, some barcodes include additional checksum characters in their symbol counts. For more information on active symbol count, refer to Configure the Active Symbol Count. Depends on barcode type. Max. length Determines the maximum supported barcode length (active symbol count) to decode. Depends on barcode type. Inverted color recognition Enables recognition of inverted barcodes that have been printed using bright ink on a dark background. ON/OFF OFF Reduced quiet zone-size Enables scanning codes with smaller than normal quiet zones (white space before and after the code) than allowed by the barcode type specification. Use this if you experience issues when scanning codes that violate quiet zone specifications. Please note that turning on this feature may lead to false positive scans in some cases

. For customers who use Code 93 and Code 128 barcodes specifically, Knox Capture may have difficulties scanning barcodes that are too small. It is recommended that customers avoid using tiny barcodes whenver possible to increase the success rate of scans. #Possible difficulties using multiscan from far ranges Testers have reported some difficulties when attempting to scan multiple barcode technologies at the same time, at ranges farther than 16 cm (6 in). It is recommended that users move in closer to the barcodes when using multiscan. Back to release notes

If there is no Knox Capture profile for the app activity, the toast message no longer appears after the device user activates one of the Knox Capture trigger buttons. This behavior applies to both the device camera and any peripheral hardware scanners attached to the device. Support for system apps in scanning profile creation Prior to Knox Capture v1.3, only 3 system apps were allowlisted when selecting apps for scanning profile creation: Samsung Internet, Google Chrome, and Samsung Messages. With this release, you can now select system apps in addition to downloaded apps when creating a profile. On the app selection screen, tap the filter icon and choose to filter the app list by Downloaded apps, System apps, or All. !System apps menu Scanning engine improvements Knox Capture v1.3 adds the following scanning engine and performance enhancements: 1D barcodes with 1px bars are now recognized more easily. Barcodes inside bitmaps can now be scanned. Barcode image localization is improved in difficult scanning situations, depending on the device or symbologies involved. Back to release notes

What setting in the Knox Capture scanning profile results in only partial barcode data being sent to the business app when using keystroke output?,Continuous scanning being enabled and Keystroke output being set to Key events.,"

The cause of partial barcode data being sent to the business app is the Keystroke output setting being configured to send scan data as Key events instead of String. When keystroke data is sent as key events, the processing time is increased. After an internal timer counts down to zero, Knox Capture assumes all data was delivered and switches focus back to the scanner overlay, sending any remaining undelivered data to the overlay instead of the business app. The resolution is to set a longer key event delay time before the focus switches back, allowing more time for all keystroke data to be delivered.",1,1,6,1.0,0.8427326679229736,0,0,10.813664674758911,"Scan data is only partially sent to business app. Overview When sending longer barcode data as keystrokes from Knox Capture to a business app, only part of the data can be seen in the business app. Pre-condition This article assumes that the following conditions are met in your Knox Capture scanning profile: 1.

Barcode capture not working for business app. Overview You may encounter situations where barcode data is not outputting correctly to your business app. Why isn't barcode capture working for my business app? Most barcode capture issues begin with minor errors in the keystroke output and scan engine settings. Try using test mode to verify your configurations after setting up a profile.

Configure keystroke output and data formatting. Knox Capture sends scanned data to business apps as keystrokes, imitating the way a user manually enters data using a keyboard. If you activate a KPE (Knox Platform for Enterprise) Premium license with a Galaxy S20 device in WP-C mode, you must set `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` to True in your EMM. Enabling this policy allows keystroke output to function as expected. Keystroke output Refer to the following settings to modify scanned data and format its output: Setting Description Options Default Send Enter character as Sets the output format for all existing and appended Enters Key event &mdash; Sends Enter as a key event. String &mdash; Sends Enter as ASCII Line Feed 0x0A. Both String and Key event &mdash; Sends Enter as ASCII Line Feed 0x0A and key event. None &mdash; Sends no output for Enter. None Send Tab character as Sets the output format for all existing and appended Tabs Key event &mdash; Sends Tab as a key event. String &mdash; Sends Tab as ASCII Horizontal Tab 0x09. Both String and Key event &mdash; Sends Tab as ASCII Horizontal Tab 0x09 and key event. None &mdash; Sends no output for Tab. None Send Carriage Return character as Sets the output format for all Carriage Returns Key event &mdash; Sends Carriage Return as a key event. String &mdash; Sends Carriage Return as ASCII Carriage Return 0x0D. Both String and Key event &mdash; Sends Carriage Return as ASCII Carriage Return 0x0D and key event. None &mdash; Sends no output for Carriage Return. None Send ASCII Control characters as Sets the output format for ASCII characters 1-31 Key event &mdash; Sends ASCII codes 1 through 31 as key events String &mdash; Sends ASCII codes 1 through 31 as strings. Both String and Key event &mdash; Sends ASCII control characters in both string and key event formats. None &mdash; Sends no output for ASCII control characters. String Send ASCII Printable characters as Sets the output format for ASCII characters 32-126 Key event &mdash; Sends ASCII characters 32-126 as key events. This is useful when a text input field, like a password input, requires key events for validation and does not accept pasted strings. String &mdash; Sends ASCII printable characters as strings. Both String and Key event &mdash; Sends ASCII printable characters as both strings and key events. None &mdash; Sends no output for ASCII printable characters. String Key event delay Sets the delay in milliseconds that Knox Capture will wait before sending a key event like Tab. Key events transmit slower than string data, which can cause synchronization problems. If your barcode output is partially cut off, try increasing the key event delay to a higher value. [0, Int32 max value] 0 Basic data formatting Refer to the following basic data formatting information to create rules to add prefixes, suffixes, and append Tab or Enter characters to scanned barcode data before output. If appending a Tab or Enter key to the data output, you must also select an output option in the Send Tab as or Sent Enter as settings above. Setting , Description , Default - , - , - Prefix to data , Prepends a string of characters to the beginning of the scanned data. None Suffix to data , Appends a string of characters to the end of the scanned data. None Append Tab characte , Appends a Tab (ASCII Horizontal Tab character, 0x09) to the end of the scanned barcode data to automate actions like moving to the adjacent cell in a spreadsheet. OFF Append Enter characte , Appends an Enter (ASCII Line Feed character, 0x0A) to the end of the scanned barcode data to automate actions like submitting a form. OFF Send as Hex , Sends the data in hexadecimal format. OFF Advanced data formatting In Knox Capture, you can add one or more rules that modify data based on certain actions and criteria. These rules convert scanned data into various formats, which are then passed to business apps through keystrokes. To create a rule and configure its actions and criteria: 1

. Test a scanner You can also test your scanner in Test mode. If any app has the Hardware scanner setting enabled, the Test apps screen shows your connected scanners under the apps. If no hardware scanner is connected, the blue test overlay displays ""Data source: No device connected"". This message is not shown if a data source is identified or a hardware scanner is connected. See Check a configuration in test mode to learn more.

Use scanner overlay. The Scanner overlay feature lets device users view the camera preview window and the business app screen concurrently. When the user triggers a barcode scan, a mini camera preview is shown over the business app screen as a picture-in-picture (PiP) window, allowing users to use the scanner and view their app's data at the same time. Functionally, the Scanner overlay behaves just like the normal scanner. When the device user aims the camera at the barcode, Knox Capture sends the scanned data to the business app depending on how the scan engine settings are configured. Enable the Scanner overlay The Scanner overlay can be enabled in both Admin and Managed modes. To enable this feature, go to the Knox Capture home screen, tap the Options button (three dots), tap Scanner overlay, then toggle the feature On. When you launch the scanner overlay for the first time, an on-screen tutorial explains how to reposition and resize the overlay. By default, the overlay appears at the top of the screen. Any size or position adjustments you make to it are saved for future scanning sessions. Tap the X in the top-right corner to close the Scanner overlay.

Knox Capture v1.7 release notes. New features #Launch of Samsung Knox Capture The most significant addition to Knox Capture v1.7 is the launch of a brand new, Samsung-developed scan engine that provides the same great feature-set as the Scandit engine, while also laying the foundations for Samsung to deliver exciting, industry-leading features to our customers in future releases. New customers will see an option to select their scan engine preference - either Knox Capture or Knox Capture: Scandit Edition - when launching the app for the first time and accepting the Knox Capture partner agreements. New customers can test the features of Knox Capture, and perform up to 100 free scans during their trial period, after which a valid Knox Suite license is required for commercial use. See Manage Knox Capture licenses to learn more about the new Knox Suite licensing requirements. #Knox Capture SDK This release introduces a brand new Knox Capture SDK to allow Android app developers to create their own barcode scanning applications. To learn more about our Knox Capture SDK, please visit our developer documentation site #Knox Capture AR (Augmented Reality) Version 1.7 of Knox Capture introduces a new AR (augmented reality) feature that displays an overlay on the device screen whenever one or more barcodes are scanned. IT admins can create AR templates to customize the information that displays on the overlay, as well as the overlay behavior. To get started with this exciting new feature, take a look at our Knox Capture AR guide for more information. #Low light scanning notification When using the camera to scan a barcode in low light conditions, a notification now displays in the capture preview window to suggest that the user enable their camera flashlight for better scanning results. This notification is enabled by default, but can be turned off by going to Knox Capture settings > Performance labs > Scanner toast notification. #Vibrate-notification after successful scan IT admins can now configure Knox Capture to vibrate the device after each successful barcode scan. This behavior is disabled by default, but can be enabled by going to a profile's Scan engine settings > Vibrate after scan. Enhancements #Output path accurately displays Paired devices list For customers who use their device as a Bluetooth wedge scanner to connect to a PC or host machine, Knox Capture now displays the Paired devices list only when the Use Bluetooth wedge slider is enabled. Previously, if a Bluetooth device was paired and the slider was in the OFF position, the Paired devices list would still show a list of disconnected devices. Now, the list only displays paired devices (connected or disconnected) if the slider is in the ON position. Known issues #Possible low barcode detection rate in certain glare or tiny conditions Testers have reported that Knox Capture can have difficulties detecting all barcodes under extreme glare conditions. It is recommended that users attempt to block or cover any glare on the barcodes before scanning. For customers who use Code 93 and Code 128 barcodes specifically, Knox Capture may have difficulties scanning barcodes that are too small. It is recommended that customers avoid using tiny barcodes whenver possible to increase the success rate of scans. #Possible difficulties using multiscan from far ranges Testers have reported some difficulties when attempting to scan multiple barcode technologies at the same time, at ranges farther than 16 cm (6 in). It is recommended that users move in closer to the barcodes when using multiscan. Back to release notes

Overview. Get started with the basics by learning what Knox Capture is and how it works. What is Knox Capture? To help explain what Knox Capture does, it may be helpful to start with an understanding of what a *wedge* scanner is, and how it relates to the Knox Capture solution. In traditional hardware-based barcode scanning terminology, a wedge scanner is a physical device that attaches between a keyboard and a computer. The keyboard attaches to the scanner, and the scanner attaches to the computer. From the computer's perspective, the scanner behaves just like an additional keyboard. When the computer runs a software program (like an inventory spreadsheet app), and barcodes are read using the wedge scanner, data is sent from the scanner to the program in the form of keystrokes. From the program's point of view, data appears exactly as if someone had typed it manually using a keyboard. How Knox Capture works In a similar way, Knox Capture also acts as a wedge between a software program and keyboard

Knox Capture v1.5 release notes. Scanner overlay Starting with Knox Capture v1.5, a scanner overlay is available. This overlay appears as a scanner preview over business apps, and enables device users to immediately see scanned data entered into an app field. Functionally, the scanner overlay works much like the full-screen scanner. When the device user aims the camera at the barcode, Knox Capture then sends the scanned data to the business app depending on whether single scan or multi-scan mode is enabled, and how Barcode selection is configured. See Use the scanner overlay to learn more. Continuous scanning for single scan mode Previously, when device users scanned single barcodes, the camera preview turned on before each scan, then off again once the scan was completed. Now, in Single scan preferences, you can turn on Continuous scanning to scan back-to-back barcodes without relaunching the camera preview after every scan

Cannot output scanned barcode data to HTML fields in Chromium-based web browsers. Overview In Knox Capture, you may experience issues outputting scanned barcode data to HTML fields in Chromium-based web browsers. This issue affects Android 11 devices and is resolved on Android 12 and higher devices. Android 11, Chromium-based browsers, including: Samsung Internet , Google Chrome , Microsoft Edge Resolution If you are experiencing this issue, there are two resolutions and one workaround for scanning barcode data into HTML fields: Using the Advanced data formatting method, Using the Floating Action Button (FAB) method, Using another web browser as a workaround #Advanced data formatting method This method has been tested and confirmed working on the following device models running Android 11 with Knox Capture 1.3.00.7: Samsung Galaxy S21, Samsung Galaxy XCover Pro, Galaxy Tab Active3 You can resolve this issue by sending a Pause command before you send the barcode data. To do this: 1. Refer to the procedure for Advanced data formatting and follow steps 1 - 6. After you tap Add Actions, a list of options opens. 2. Select Send Pause and tap Add. 3. Tap Add Actions again, then select Send remaining characters and tap Add. 4. Verify that the two actions, Send Pause and Send remaining characters, are on the rule screen. 5. Close the Knox Capture app and perform a test scan in Chrome or Samsung Internet. #Enable the Floating Action Button (FAB) You can also resolve this issue by using a Floating Action Button (FAB) instead of the hardware key to perform a scan. To enable the FAB in Knox Capture, refer to step 6 in Set camera scan trigger. #Workaround using another web browser To avoid this issue altogether, you can output your scanned data to a web browser built with a different browser engine, such as Mozilla Firefox.

If you do not add a configuration for Knox Capture in Managed Google Play when updating a license key, the app operates according to its _previous_ configuration. For example, a device with an existing scan configuration will continue to operate in Managed mode after updating the license key. However, a new device without an existing configuration will operate in Admin mode. To ensure _all_ devices operate in Managed mode, prepare and include the configuration each time you add or modify the app within the EMM console

Export and deploy configuration. Knox Capture uses a simple EMM-based deployment model. You first need to export a scanning configuration as a .txt file, then use an EMM add the file to your app configuration to deploy Knox Capture as a managed-app to your end-users. Exporting a configuration Exporting and sharing a scan configuration enables other devices apply the configuration to their installation. #Export options An IT admin can use several methods to export the configuration: Save it as a file on the device. Email it as a file attachment. Use Nearby share to send to another IT admin's device, Generate a QR code that can be scanned by other IT admins. To share a configuration on a per-device basis, transfer the configuration using near-field communication (NFC) or with a QR code. #Launch the export menu Regardless of the export method selected, begin by tapping the Share button in the lower-right of the home page to launch the Share configuration menu. #Save as file To save the file: 1. Tap the Save icon in the Share configuration menu. 2. Enter a name and tap Done. Knox Capture saves the configuration within My Files > Downloads, and displays a success message. #Email file To email the configuration as a text file attachment with the default email program: 1. Tap the email icon within the Share configuration menu. 2. Knox Capture launches the email application and starts a new message with the configuration file attached. #Nearby share To share a configuration with another device using Nearby share: 1. Tap the Nearby icon within the Share configuration menu. 2. Ensure Nearby Share is turned on for both the transmitting and receiving devices. 3. On the receiving device, tap the Device nearby is sharing popup that appears. #QR code To generate a QR code that can be scanned by other devices to import the configuration, tap the QR code option in the Share configuration menu. Knox Capture generates and displays a QR code. Optionally save or email the QR code by tapping either the Save or Email button. Tap Save to save the QR code as an image within the device My Files > Downloads folder. Tap Email to launch the default email app. The resulting email message includes instructions for importing the configuration using the QR code. If the configuration is too large for one QR code, Knox Capture generates multiple QR codes in a PDF file. The end user must scan them all to complete the import process. Deploying through an EMM To deploy Knox Capture with a custom scanning configuration across a fleet of devices, set the scan configuration and use the EMM console to add it to Knox Capture's App Config in Managed Google Play. Doing so ensures devices that the app runs for end-users in Managed mode. Deployment varies depending on the EMM provider, but should resemble the following flow: 1. Install Knox Capture on an admin device, configure the app, and export the configuration as a text file. 2. Add the Knox Capture app to your Managed Google Play Store. 3. Assign the app to a group or organization and launch the app configuration dialog. In most consoles, the app configuration (or App Config) dialog opens as a pop-up window or modal. 4. Activate your license in the EMM. 5. Copy and paste the text of the exported Knox Capture configuration into the provided configuration field. 6. Save the updated settings and deploy. If you do not add a configuration for Knox Capture in Managed Google Play when updating a license key, the app operates according to its _previous_ configuration.

However, a new device without an existing configuration will operate in Admin mode. To ensure _all_ devices operate in Managed mode, prepare and include the configuration each time you add or modify the app within the EMM console. Sharing and importing configurations Once a configuration has been exported, it can be shared with other devices running the app in Admin mode",369

"How does Knox Capture send data to applications, making it appear as if someone typed it manually using a keyboard?","Knox Capture acts as a mobile solution built for compatible Android smartphones and tablets. It wedges between an application and the mobile device's on-screen keyboard, allowing end-users to trigger a barcode scan using the device's camera."," Based on the paragraphs describing how Knox Capture works and the definition of a wedge scanner, Knox Capture acts as middleware to translate barcode data into a string, format the string, and send the formatted string to a business app as keystrokes. This makes it appear to the business app as if someone manually typed in the data using a keyboard. Specifically:

""In a similar way, Knox Capture also acts as a wedge between a software program and keyboard...When the computer runs a software program (like an inventory spreadsheet app), and barcodes are read using the wedge scanner, data is sent from the scanner to the program in the form of keystrokes. From the program's point of view, data appears exactly as if someone had typed it manually using a keyboard.""

""Knox Capture takes care of integrating with your business app, so that you don't have to build barcode scanning logic into your business app using a software development kit (SDK).""

So in summary, Knox Capture sends the formatted barcode data to business apps as keystrokes, making it appear as if someone had manually typed in the data using a keyboard.",0,0,6,0.0,0.9618934988975525,1,0,18.960046768188477,"Configure keystroke output and data formatting. Knox Capture sends scanned data to business apps as keystrokes, imitating the way a user manually enters data using a keyboard. If you activate a KPE (Knox Platform for Enterprise) Premium license with a Galaxy S20 device in WP-C mode, you must set `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` to True in your EMM. Enabling this policy allows keystroke output to function as expected. Keystroke output Refer to the following settings to modify scanned data and format its output: Setting Description Options Default Send Enter character as Sets the output format for all existing and appended Enters Key event &mdash; Sends Enter as a key event. String &mdash; Sends Enter as ASCII Line Feed 0x0A. Both String and Key event &mdash; Sends Enter as ASCII Line Feed 0x0A and key event. None &mdash; Sends no output for Enter. None Send Tab character as Sets the output format for all existing and appended Tabs Key event &mdash; Sends Tab as a key event

Scan data is only partially sent to business app. Overview When sending longer barcode data as keystrokes from Knox Capture to a business app, only part of the data can be seen in the business app. Pre-condition This article assumes that the following conditions are met in your Knox Capture scanning profile: 1. Continuous scanning is enabled. This setting is disabled by default. 2. Keystroke output is configured to send scan data as Key events. By default, this value is set to String. Cause When Keystroke data is configured to send as a key event (rather than a string), the processing time is increased. After an internal timer counts down to zero, Knox Capture assumes that all scanned data was delivered successfully to the target field in the business app, and switches the focus back to the scanner overlay. The remaining undelivered data is then sent to the scanner overlay instead of the business app. Resolution In the Knox Capture profile settings, navigate to Keystroke output > Set key event delay and extend the length of time before the foreground focus switches back to the scanner overlay. By default, the key event delay is set to 0 ms. The delay you set occurs between individual key events sent to the business app. For example, when sending scan data that's 10 characters long with a 50 ms key event delay, a 500 ms total delay can be observed.

Overview. Get started with the basics by learning what Knox Capture is and how it works. What is Knox Capture? To help explain what Knox Capture does, it may be helpful to start with an understanding of what a *wedge* scanner is, and how it relates to the Knox Capture solution. In traditional hardware-based barcode scanning terminology, a wedge scanner is a physical device that attaches between a keyboard and a computer. The keyboard attaches to the scanner, and the scanner attaches to the computer. From the computer's perspective, the scanner behaves just like an additional keyboard. When the computer runs a software program (like an inventory spreadsheet app), and barcodes are read using the wedge scanner, data is sent from the scanner to the program in the form of keystrokes. From the program's point of view, data appears exactly as if someone had typed it manually using a keyboard. How Knox Capture works In a similar way, Knox Capture also acts as a wedge between a software program and keyboard

Configure keystroke output and data formatting. Knox Capture sends scanned data to business apps as keystrokes, imitating the way a user manually enters data using a keyboard. If you activate a KPE (Knox Platform for Enterprise) Premium license with a Galaxy S20 device in WP-C mode, you must set `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` to True in your EMM. Enabling this policy allows keystroke output to function as expected. Keystroke output Refer to the following settings to modify scanned data and format its output: Setting Description Options Default Send Enter character as Sets the output format for all existing and appended Enters Key event &mdash; Sends Enter as a key event. String &mdash; Sends Enter as ASCII Line Feed 0x0A. Both String and Key event &mdash; Sends Enter as ASCII Line Feed 0x0A and key event. None &mdash; Sends no output for Enter. None Send Tab character as Sets the output format for all existing and appended Tabs Key event &mdash; Sends Tab as a key event. String &mdash; Sends Tab as ASCII Horizontal Tab 0x09. Both String and Key event &mdash; Sends Tab as ASCII Horizontal Tab 0x09 and key event. None &mdash; Sends no output for Tab. None Send Carriage Return character as Sets the output format for all Carriage Returns Key event &mdash; Sends Carriage Return as a key event. String &mdash; Sends Carriage Return as ASCII Carriage Return 0x0D. Both String and Key event &mdash; Sends Carriage Return as ASCII Carriage Return 0x0D and key event. None &mdash; Sends no output for Carriage Return. None Send ASCII Control characters as Sets the output format for ASCII characters 1-31 Key event &mdash; Sends ASCII codes 1 through 31 as key events String &mdash; Sends ASCII codes 1 through 31 as strings. Both String and Key event &mdash; Sends ASCII control characters in both string and key event formats. None &mdash; Sends no output for ASCII control characters. String Send ASCII Printable characters as Sets the output format for ASCII characters 32-126 Key event &mdash; Sends ASCII characters 32-126 as key events. This is useful when a text input field, like a password input, requires key events for validation and does not accept pasted strings. String &mdash; Sends ASCII printable characters as strings. Both String and Key event &mdash; Sends ASCII printable characters as both strings and key events. None &mdash; Sends no output for ASCII printable characters. String Key event delay Sets the delay in milliseconds that Knox Capture will wait before sending a key event like Tab. Key events transmit slower than string data, which can cause synchronization problems. If your barcode output is partially cut off, try increasing the key event delay to a higher value. [0, Int32 max value] 0 Basic data formatting Refer to the following basic data formatting information to create rules to add prefixes, suffixes, and append Tab or Enter characters to scanned barcode data before output. If appending a Tab or Enter key to the data output, you must also select an output option in the Send Tab as or Sent Enter as settings above. Setting , Description , Default - , - , - Prefix to data , Prepends a string of characters to the beginning of the scanned data. None Suffix to data , Appends a string of characters to the end of the scanned data. None Append Tab characte , Appends a Tab (ASCII Horizontal Tab character, 0x09) to the end of the scanned barcode data to automate actions like moving to the adjacent cell in a spreadsheet. OFF Append Enter characte , Appends an Enter (ASCII Line Feed character, 0x0A) to the end of the scanned barcode data to automate actions like submitting a form. OFF Send as Hex , Sends the data in hexadecimal format. OFF Advanced data formatting In Knox Capture, you can add one or more rules that modify data based on certain actions and criteria. These rules convert scanned data into various formats, which are then passed to business apps through keystrokes. To create a rule and configure its actions and criteria: 1

Why is Knox Capture called a wedge? . A wedge barcode scanner is a physical device that attaches to a keyboard or a computer. It reads barcode data and translates it to a string that is then input into the system, as if a user had manually typed the string using the keyboard. In the same way, Knox Capture acts as middleware that reads barcode data captured by the XCover Pro device, translates it into a string, formats the string, and then sends it to a third-party business app that understands the resulting data. Knox Capture takes care of integrating with your business app, so that you don't have to build barcode scanning logic into your business app using a software development kit (SDK). So how does Knox Capture know which barcodes to read, how to format the data, and which business app to send the data to? The IT admin defines those details in a profile in Knox Capture. Once the IT admin has configured the profile, they push it to enterprise devices through their EMM",1128

Overview. Get started with the basics by learning what Knox Capture is and how it works. What is Knox Capture? To help explain what Knox Capture does, it may be helpful to start with an understanding of what a *wedge* scanner is, and how it relates to the Knox Capture solution.

How Knox Capture works In a similar way, Knox Capture also acts as a wedge between a software program and keyboard. However, instead of being a physical scanning device, Knox Capture is a mobile solution built for compatible Android smartphones and tablets. Enterprise IT admins can either download the Knox Capture app from Google Play, or custom-build their own wedge scanner apps using the Knox Capture SDK (Software Development Kit). Once Knox Capture is installed and running on a device, it *wedges* between an application (for example, a business app used to track inventory) and the mobile device's on-screen keyboard. When an end-user launches their business app, they can simply tap an on-screen button or press a hardware button on their device to trigger a barcode scan using the device's camera. After the camera focuses on a barcode, Knox Capture translates the barcode data into keystrokes, which then get passed back to the business app for processing.

This mode allows the device user - typically an enterprise IT admin - to utilize the full functionality of the app to primarily do the following: 1. Create scanning profiles that define which apps can launch the barcode scanner, which barcode types can be scanned (QR, Code 128, EAN8, etc.), and how scanned data is formatted (append Tab or Enter key, insert special characters before or after data, etc.). 2. Test scanning profiles to ensure that appropriate business apps can launch the scanner and receive data back as keystrokes. 3. Export profile settings as a configuration file, which can then be used by EMM/UEM administrators to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to end-user devices. #Managed mode After an IT admin uses their EMM/UEM to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to an end-user's device, the device launches the app in Managed mode. In Managed mode, Knox Capture functionality is greatly reduced. End-users can review their scanning profile settings and perform barcode scans using their business apps (as permitted by their scanning profile), however they can't make changes to their scanning profiles, export profile settings, or switch to Admin mode by activating a Knox Capture license. Admin mode is the default mode of operation for Knox Capture. The procedures described in this guide are targeted at an IT admin audience.

Scanning profiles. Knox Capture acts as a wedge by translating barcode data into keystrokes that can be sent to a business application. But how does Knox Capture know what barcode types to scan, how to interpret scanned data, and which business applications to pass the data to? For Knox Capture, the *Scanning profile* defines the app's core behavior. A Scanning Profile is a configuration file that gets created or modified by an IT admin using the Knox Capture application. The profile defines how Knox Capture performs a barcode scan, and primarily consists of the following parameters: 1. Apps and activities - define which applications that can launch the Knox Capture scanner. 2. Scanner engine settings - specifying the barcode technologies (QR, Code 128, UPCA, etc.), scanning methods (single barcode, multi barcode), and camera behavior (enable flash, allow camera zoom). 3. Keystroke output rules - specifying how barcode data gets converted into keystrokes (append Tab or Enter character to each barcode, add prefix or suffix characters, convert output to hex characters, etc.) Default scanning profile Out-of-the-box, Knox Capture includes a default scanning profile that gets automatically associated with all apps on the device.

For example, an IT admin can modify the default profile to append a Tab key at the end of each barcode, but they cannot change which apps can trigger the scanner. Custom scanning profiles While the default scanning profile allows Knox Capture to be used right away without any configuration, IT admins may want to use a custom profile to better suit their needs. With a custom profile, IT admins control which apps and activities can trigger a barcode scan. Any apps that you don't select in the custom profile will follow the default behavior in that the barcode scanner is active for all apps not specified in the custom profile. Creating custom scanning profiles Custom profiles can be created by modifying the default profile settings, or by creating entirely new profiles altogether. 1. Tap the + button near the top of the app UI to open the profile creation options. 2. Select Create profile to start a profile from scratch, or select Duplicate existing profile to copy the settings from an existing (custom or default) profile. Alternatively, you can create a custom profile by clicking Create profile without clicking the + button. 3. Provide a profile name, then tap Done. The new profile appears in the profiles area below Defult scanning profile.

- smartscan_config - This key is used to paste the text of the exported Knox Capture configuration.

The relevant context from the passage: 

""5. Copy and paste the text of the exported Knox Capture configuration into the provided configuration field. 6. Save the updated settings and deploy. If you do not add a configuration for Knox Capture in Managed Google Play when updating a license key, the app operates according to its previous configuration.""

This section mentions the two configuration keys needed to activate the license and configure the app for managed mode deployment.",1,2,6,0.5,0.998040497303009,1,0,7.373029708862305,". 3. Assign the app to a group or organization and launch the app configuration dialog. In most consoles, the app configuration (or App Config) dialog opens as a pop-up window or modal. 4. Activate your license in the EMM. 5. Copy and paste the text of the exported Knox Capture configuration into the provided configuration field. 6. Save the updated settings and deploy. If you do not add a configuration for Knox Capture in Managed Google Play when updating a license key, the app operates according to its _previous_ configuration. For example, a device with an existing scan configuration will continue to operate in Managed mode after updating the license key. However, a new device without an existing configuration will operate in Admin mode. To ensure _all_ devices operate in Managed mode, prepare and include the configuration each time you add or modify the app within the EMM console

. In a typical console, the app configuration dialog opens as a pop-up window or modal. 3. Activate the license by pasting it into the field within the app configuration (App Config) screen. 4. Copy and paste the exported configuration into the provided app configuration field. Adding a configuration to Managed Google Play is the only step necessary to ensure all devices installing the app operate in Managed mode. However, if you're using a trial version of Knox Capture, you'll need to push a Knox Suite license key as well. Refer to the following table for details on the configuration data: Configuration key , Configuration type , Configuration value - , - , - smartscan_license , String , Knox license key smartscan_config , String , Exported configuration data from Knox Capture 5. Save the updated settings and deploy. Summary You have now completed a typical Knox Capture workflow for IT admins, and have been introduced to configuring and deploying the app to managed devices

Export and deploy configuration. Knox Capture uses a simple EMM-based deployment model. You first need to export a scanning configuration as a .txt file, then use an EMM add the file to your app configuration to deploy Knox Capture as a managed-app to your end-users. Exporting a configuration Exporting and sharing a scan configuration enables other devices apply the configuration to their installation. #Export options An IT admin can use several methods to export the configuration: Save it as a file on the device. Email it as a file attachment. Use Nearby share to send to another IT admin's device, Generate a QR code that can be scanned by other IT admins. To share a configuration on a per-device basis, transfer the configuration using near-field communication (NFC) or with a QR code. #Launch the export menu Regardless of the export method selected, begin by tapping the Share button in the lower-right of the home page to launch the Share configuration menu. #Save as file To save the file: 1. Tap the Save icon in the Share configuration menu. 2. Enter a name and tap Done. Knox Capture saves the configuration within My Files > Downloads, and displays a success message. #Email file To email the configuration as a text file attachment with the default email program: 1. Tap the email icon within the Share configuration menu. 2. Knox Capture launches the email application and starts a new message with the configuration file attached. #Nearby share To share a configuration with another device using Nearby share: 1. Tap the Nearby icon within the Share configuration menu. 2. Ensure Nearby Share is turned on for both the transmitting and receiving devices. 3. On the receiving device, tap the Device nearby is sharing popup that appears. #QR code To generate a QR code that can be scanned by other devices to import the configuration, tap the QR code option in the Share configuration menu. Knox Capture generates and displays a QR code. Optionally save or email the QR code by tapping either the Save or Email button. Tap Save to save the QR code as an image within the device My Files > Downloads folder. Tap Email to launch the default email app. The resulting email message includes instructions for importing the configuration using the QR code. If the configuration is too large for one QR code, Knox Capture generates multiple QR codes in a PDF file. The end user must scan them all to complete the import process. Deploying through an EMM To deploy Knox Capture with a custom scanning configuration across a fleet of devices, set the scan configuration and use the EMM console to add it to Knox Capture's App Config in Managed Google Play. Doing so ensures devices that the app runs for end-users in Managed mode. Deployment varies depending on the EMM provider, but should resemble the following flow: 1. Install Knox Capture on an admin device, configure the app, and export the configuration as a text file. 2. Add the Knox Capture app to your Managed Google Play Store. 3. Assign the app to a group or organization and launch the app configuration dialog. In most consoles, the app configuration (or App Config) dialog opens as a pop-up window or modal. 4. Activate your license in the EMM. 5. Copy and paste the text of the exported Knox Capture configuration into the provided configuration field. 6. Save the updated settings and deploy. If you do not add a configuration for Knox Capture in Managed Google Play when updating a license key, the app operates according to its _previous_ configuration. For example, a device with an existing scan configuration will continue to operate in Managed mode after updating the license key. However, a new device without an existing configuration will operate in Admin mode. To ensure _all_ devices operate in Managed mode, prepare and include the configuration each time you add or modify the app within the EMM console. Sharing and importing configurations Once a configuration has been exported, it can be shared with other devices running the app in Admin mode

. 3. Export profile settings as a configuration file, which can then be used by EMM/UEM administrators to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to end-user devices. #Managed mode After an IT admin uses their EMM/UEM to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to an end-user's device, the device launches the app in Managed mode. In Managed mode, Knox Capture functionality is greatly reduced. End-users can review their scanning profile settings and perform barcode scans using their business apps (as permitted by their scanning profile), however they can't make changes to their scanning profiles, export profile settings, or switch to Admin mode by activating a Knox Capture license. Admin mode is the default mode of operation for Knox Capture. The procedures described in this guide are targeted at an IT admin audience.

Edit the license field in the Knox Capture app configuration. On the app configuration screen in your EMM, replace the existing license key string with DEACTIVATE and save your changes. Once the Knox Capture agent detects the new string, the license is deactivated. Before editing the license field, verify whether you are targeting the correct devices in your EMM. Failure to do so may cause all your devices to be unenrolled from Knox Capture. Unenroll the device from your EMM. Doing so forces an app uninstallation and releases the device's license seat. #By uninstalling the Knox Capture app To manually deactivate the license seat for a device, simply uninstall the Knox Capture app",355

Overview. Get started with the basics by learning what Knox Capture is and how it works. What is Knox Capture? To help explain what Knox Capture does, it may be helpful to start with an understanding of what a *wedge* scanner is, and how it relates to the Knox Capture solution. In traditional hardware-based barcode scanning terminology, a wedge scanner is a physical device that attaches between a keyboard and a computer. The keyboard attaches to the scanner, and the scanner attaches to the computer. From the computer's perspective, the scanner behaves just like an additional keyboard. When the computer runs a software program (like an inventory spreadsheet app), and barcodes are read using the wedge scanner, data is sent from the scanner to the program in the form of keystrokes. From the program's point of view, data appears exactly as if someone had typed it manually using a keyboard. How Knox Capture works In a similar way, Knox Capture also acts as a wedge between a software program and keyboard

Overview. Get started with the basics by learning what Knox Capture is and how it works. What is Knox Capture? To help explain what Knox Capture does, it may be helpful to start with an understanding of what a *wedge* scanner is, and how it relates to the Knox Capture solution. In traditional hardware-based barcode scanning terminology, a wedge scanner is a physical device that attaches between a keyboard and a computer. The keyboard attaches to the scanner, and the scanner attaches to the computer. From the computer's perspective, the scanner behaves just like an additional keyboard. When the computer runs a software program (like an inventory spreadsheet app), and barcodes are read using the wedge scanner, data is sent from the scanner to the program in the form of keystrokes. From the program's point of view, data appears exactly as if someone had typed it manually using a keyboard. How Knox Capture works In a similar way, Knox Capture also acts as a wedge between a software program and keyboard. However, instead of being a physical scanning device, Knox Capture is a mobile solution built for compatible Android smartphones and tablets. Enterprise IT admins can either download the Knox Capture app from Google Play, or custom-build their own wedge scanner apps using the Knox Capture SDK (Software Development Kit). Once Knox Capture is installed and running on a device, it *wedges* between an application (for example, a business app used to track inventory) and the mobile device's on-screen keyboard. When an end-user launches their business app, they can simply tap an on-screen button or press a hardware button on their device to trigger a barcode scan using the device's camera. After the camera focuses on a barcode, Knox Capture translates the barcode data into keystrokes, which then get passed back to the business app for processing. From the business app's point of view, keystrokes coming from Knox Capture appear exactly as if a user had typed them from the device keyboard. Who can use Knox Capture? Knox Capture is designed for anyone who wants to turn their mobile device into a powerful barcode scanner. However, depending on whether it's being used by an admin or an end-user, its features vary significantly. #Admin mode (Default) When Knox Capture is downloaded from Google Play and installed on a compatible Android device - and a valid license key is activated - the app operates in its default Admin mode. This mode allows the device user - typically an enterprise IT admin - to utilize the full functionality of the app to primarily do the following: 1. Create scanning profiles that define which apps can launch the barcode scanner, which barcode types can be scanned (QR, Code 128, EAN8, etc.), and how scanned data is formatted (append Tab or Enter key, insert special characters before or after data, etc.). 2. Test scanning profiles to ensure that appropriate business apps can launch the scanner and receive data back as keystrokes. 3. Export profile settings as a configuration file, which can then be used by EMM/UEM administrators to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to end-user devices. #Managed mode After an IT admin uses their EMM/UEM to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to an end-user's device, the device launches the app in Managed mode. In Managed mode, Knox Capture functionality is greatly reduced. End-users can review their scanning profile settings and perform barcode scans using their business apps (as permitted by their scanning profile), however they can't make changes to their scanning profiles, export profile settings, or switch to Admin mode by activating a Knox Capture license. Admin mode is the default mode of operation for Knox Capture. The procedures described in this guide are targeted at an IT admin audience. Further reading #Getting started tutorials These tutorials provide a guided workflow for new admins and end-users. While they don't cover every setting or scenario when using Knox Capture, they do provide a good starting point for learning the app's basics",220
What are the two formats for viewing scanned barcode data in test mode without any keystroke output rules applied?,The two formats for viewing scanned barcode data in test mode without any keystroke output rules applied are the test mode notation and the hexadecimal format.," Ignore the XML tags.

<answer>
According to the context, the two formats for viewing scanned barcode data in test mode without any keystroke output rules applied are:

1. Scanned data - The scanned barcode data in test mode notation without any keystroke output rules applied.

2. Scanned raw - The scanned barcode data in hexadecimal format without any keystroke output rules applied.

</answer>",1,1,6,1.0,0.9999263286590576,1,0,4.900191068649292,". Scanned data - The scanned barcode data in test mode notation without any keystroke output rules applied. Scanned raw - The scanned barcode data in hexadecimal format without any keystroke output rules applied. 4. Expand the overlay by tapping its down arrow icon for a full view of the test data. 5. Inspect and compare the Scanned data to the Output value to verify the correct keystroke output rules and scanning settings for the activity in question. 6. Repeat for each app included in the configuration as required. After testing an app, there should be a green check mark badge next to the app logo on the Test apps screen. Use this to track testing progress. 7. Tap All activities under an app to open a list of app activities that are included in the profile you're testing. Here, you can check if individual activities were tested. If so, a green checkmark appears next to the activity. 8

. 2. Review the content of the blue test overlay in the open app's UI. The overlay displays: Activity - The name of the activity in focus. Active profile - The Knox Capture profile to which the in-focus activity belongs. This is the profile defining scan settings and keystroke output rules for the in-focus activity. Scan a barcode and view the test overlay Each scanning experience differs depending on the configuration. For example, the camera may not automatically scan a barcode. For more information, see Scan engine settings. 1. Press the camera scan trigger to open the camera for scanning. 2. Aim the camera at the barcode to scan. 3. View the test overlay. You should see the following new values: Output - The processed data in test mode notation with keystroke output rules applied. Scanned data - The scanned barcode data in test mode notation without any keystroke output rules applied. Scanned raw - The scanned barcode data in hexadecimal format without any keystroke output rules applied. 4

. For example, ""abc"" will appear as ""abc"" in the test overlay. Non-printable ASCII control characters get embedded in curly brackets. For example, a Tab control character will appear as """" in the test overlay if sent as a string. ##Key event Printable and non-printable characters appear in their character representation embedded in angle brackets when sent as key events. For example, if sent as key events, the data `abHT` appears as `` in the test overlay. Example The following example applies test mode notation to scanned barcode data based on a small set of keystroke output rules. Barcode input: `abc\n123\teh` This input uses escape sequences for control characters. `\n` represents Enter and `\t` represents Tab. Keystroke output rules: Send Enter as String, Send Tab as Key event, Send ASCII Printable characters as String Test mode notation: Scanned data: `abc123eh`, Output : `abc123 eh`

Configure keystroke output and data formatting. Knox Capture sends scanned data to business apps as keystrokes, imitating the way a user manually enters data using a keyboard. If you activate a KPE (Knox Platform for Enterprise) Premium license with a Galaxy S20 device in WP-C mode, you must set `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` to True in your EMM. Enabling this policy allows keystroke output to function as expected. Keystroke output Refer to the following settings to modify scanned data and format its output: Setting Description Options Default Send Enter character as Sets the output format for all existing and appended Enters Key event &mdash; Sends Enter as a key event. String &mdash; Sends Enter as ASCII Line Feed 0x0A. Both String and Key event &mdash; Sends Enter as ASCII Line Feed 0x0A and key event. None &mdash; Sends no output for Enter. None Send Tab character as Sets the output format for all existing and appended Tabs Key event &mdash; Sends Tab as a key event. String &mdash; Sends Tab as ASCII Horizontal Tab 0x09. Both String and Key event &mdash; Sends Tab as ASCII Horizontal Tab 0x09 and key event. None &mdash; Sends no output for Tab. None Send Carriage Return character as Sets the output format for all Carriage Returns Key event &mdash; Sends Carriage Return as a key event. String &mdash; Sends Carriage Return as ASCII Carriage Return 0x0D. Both String and Key event &mdash; Sends Carriage Return as ASCII Carriage Return 0x0D and key event. None &mdash; Sends no output for Carriage Return. None Send ASCII Control characters as Sets the output format for ASCII characters 1-31 Key event &mdash; Sends ASCII codes 1 through 31 as key events String &mdash; Sends ASCII codes 1 through 31 as strings. Both String and Key event &mdash; Sends ASCII control characters in both string and key event formats. None &mdash; Sends no output for ASCII control characters. String Send ASCII Printable characters as Sets the output format for ASCII characters 32-126 Key event &mdash; Sends ASCII characters 32-126 as key events. This is useful when a text input field, like a password input, requires key events for validation and does not accept pasted strings. String &mdash; Sends ASCII printable characters as strings. Both String and Key event &mdash; Sends ASCII printable characters as both strings and key events. None &mdash; Sends no output for ASCII printable characters. String Key event delay Sets the delay in milliseconds that Knox Capture will wait before sending a key event like Tab. Key events transmit slower than string data, which can cause synchronization problems. If your barcode output is partially cut off, try increasing the key event delay to a higher value. [0, Int32 max value] 0 Basic data formatting Refer to the following basic data formatting information to create rules to add prefixes, suffixes, and append Tab or Enter characters to scanned barcode data before output. If appending a Tab or Enter key to the data output, you must also select an output option in the Send Tab as or Sent Enter as settings above. Setting , Description , Default - , - , - Prefix to data , Prepends a string of characters to the beginning of the scanned data.

Knox Capture v1.8 release notes. New features Knox Capture v1.8 introduces the following new features: #Continuous single scan A new Continuous scanning option appears on the Scan engine settings > Single scan preferences screen. When this option is toggled On, device users can scan several barcodes in sequence - and have each scan be registered as a single event - without having to press the camera trigger button between each scan. To learn more about the Continuous scanning feature, see Single scan preferences. #Scanner overlay In this release, device users have the option to view the camera preview window as an overlay on top of their business app. When the Scanner overlay feature is enabled and a scan is triggered, users will see a mini camera preview window on top of their existing business app screen. To learn more about this new feature, see Scanner overlay. #Inverse color barcode support This release adds a new Performance lab feature that allows users to scan inverse colored barcodes. This feature only works with Data Matrix and QR type barcodes in this release. To enable this option, go to the Knox Capture main screen, then tap the Options button (three dots), tap Performance lab, then enable Inverted color recognition. Enhancements Knox Capture v1.8 includes the following enhancements to existing features: #More intuitive user prompts when connecting USB device Previously, users would get a prompt even if Knox Capture wasn't running in the foreground. For example, a user might want to connect a USB keyboard for use in their business. When connecting the keyboard, they would see a prompt asking if they wanted to use the USB keyboard for scanning purposes, even though they may not be using Knox Capture at the time. This release improves the prompt so that it only shows when Knox Capture is being used in the foreground. The device user must grant system permissions for connected devices in order for the prompt to display. If no permissions are granted, the prompt will not display on any screen. #Seamlessly switch between multiple paired devices in Output path If a user is paired with multiple devices in Knox Capture's Output path, they can now switch between each of their paired devices more easily. Previously, if a user had two paired devices in Output path, and Knox Capture was connected to _device A_, the user would first have to disconnect from _device A_ before connecting to _device B_. With this release, the user simply has to connect to _device B_. Knox Capture automatically disconnects from any previously paired devices. #Receive a notification when overlay is restricted by IT admin Some device users may experience an issue where they are unable to view the camera preview window after triggering a scan. This issue can be caused by a restriction set by the IT admin and the organization's UEM policy. Previously, if the restriction was set, the user would simply not be able to see the preview window.

The correlation between characters and symbol counts depends on the encoding standard. For instance, Code 128 differs from Code 39. For Code 128, there are three different encoding schemes that can be mixed within a single Code 128 barcode to achieve the shortest possible code. Resolution Check which encoding standards your barcode data follows.

. Change this property to include lengths not enabled by default, or to optimize decoding performance for a certain number of symbols. Character-to-symbol mapping depends on barcode type. For example, some barcodes include additional checksum characters in their symbol counts. For more information on active symbol count, refer to Configure the Active Symbol Count. Depends on barcode type. Max. length Determines the maximum supported barcode length (active symbol count) to decode. Depends on barcode type. Inverted color recognition Enables recognition of inverted barcodes that have been printed using bright ink on a dark background.

Knox Capture v1.2 release notes. This Knox Capture v1.2 release, scheduled to go live on July 30, 2021, includes several new features and improvements to existing functionality. Starting with Knox Capture v1.2, devices running an Android version lower than 11 (R) are not supported. On these devices, downloading Knox Capture from the Google Play store installs v1.1 instead. All customers should upgrade devices to Android 11 (R) OS binary before v1.2 can be downloaded. Expanded device support In Knox Capture v1.2, support is added for the following devices: Galaxy XCover 4S, Galaxy Tab Active Pro, Galaxy S20, Galaxy S21 Only the keyboard scan icon and floating scan button are supported on non-rugged devices (S20 and S21). For a full list of supported devices, see Supported devices. Keystroke output support in WP-C deployments In previous Knox Capture versions, if an IT admin activated a KPE Premium license with a WP-C deployment, remote injection was blocked in WP-C mode. As a workaround, `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` must be set to True to support keystroke output. With this release, keystroke output in WP-C deployments is supported regardless of whether `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` is set to True. Keystroke output support is not yet available for Galaxy S20 devices. You must use the aforementioned workaround to use keystroke output on Galaxy S20 devices. Option to disable default profile IT admins can now enable or disable the default profile. If you create profiles for several applications and don't want the default profile's behavior to override any configurations, set the default profile to Off. The default profile setting is available on the Knox Capture main page. You can change the configuration at any time, export and deploy it to end users in Managed mode. If a profile is not active for an app or foreground activity and the end user attempts to scan a barcode, an error message is shown stating that the application does not support Knox Capture scanning. This setting cannot be changed in Managed mode. New floating button scan trigger !Hardware scan trigger setting !Hardware scan trigger setting A floating scan button is now available that launches the Knox Capture camera for scanning. By default, the scan button appears in the bottom right corner of the device's screen. Users can move it around the screen, and it remains in the last known position until it's toggled off. The scan button can be used in both Admin and Managed modes. See Set camera trigger for more information on the various available triggers. License activation menu for unmanaged devices Previously, Knox Capture licenses could only be used by organizations pushing them through an MDM.

What new feature allows users to seamlessly switch between multiple paired devices in the output path without having to manually disconnect from one device before connecting to another?,"With this release, users now can switch between each of their paired devices more easily. They no longer need to manually disconnect from one device before connecting to another.","

The new feature that allows users to seamlessly switch between multiple paired devices in the output path is called Seamlessly switch between multiple paired devices in Output path. Previously, if a user had two paired devices in Output path and Knox Capture was connected to device A, the user would first have to disconnect from device A before connecting to device B. With this release, the user simply has to connect to device B. Knox Capture automatically disconnects from any previously paired devices.",1,1,6,1.0,0.9991236329078674,1,0,7.356889009475708,"Knox Capture v1.8 release notes. New features Knox Capture v1.8 introduces the following new features: #Continuous single scan A new Continuous scanning option appears on the Scan engine settings > Single scan preferences screen. When this option is toggled On, device users can scan several barcodes in sequence - and have each scan be registered as a single event - without having to press the camera trigger button between each scan. To learn more about the Continuous scanning feature, see Single scan preferences. #Scanner overlay In this release, device users have the option to view the camera preview window as an overlay on top of their business app. When the Scanner overlay feature is enabled and a scan is triggered, users will see a mini camera preview window on top of their existing business app screen. To learn more about this new feature, see Scanner overlay. #Inverse color barcode support This release adds a new Performance lab feature that allows users to scan inverse colored barcodes. This feature only works with Data Matrix and QR type barcodes in this release. To enable this option, go to the Knox Capture main screen, then tap the Options button (three dots), tap Performance lab, then enable Inverted color recognition. Enhancements Knox Capture v1.8 includes the following enhancements to existing features: #More intuitive user prompts when connecting USB device Previously, users would get a prompt even if Knox Capture wasn't running in the foreground. For example, a user might want to connect a USB keyboard for use in their business. When connecting the keyboard, they would see a prompt asking if they wanted to use the USB keyboard for scanning purposes, even though they may not be using Knox Capture at the time. This release improves the prompt so that it only shows when Knox Capture is being used in the foreground. The device user must grant system permissions for connected devices in order for the prompt to display. If no permissions are granted, the prompt will not display on any screen. #Seamlessly switch between multiple paired devices in Output path If a user is paired with multiple devices in Knox Capture's Output path, they can now switch between each of their paired devices more easily. Previously, if a user had two paired devices in Output path, and Knox Capture was connected to _device A_, the user would first have to disconnect from _device A_ before connecting to _device B_. With this release, the user simply has to connect to _device B_. Knox Capture automatically disconnects from any previously paired devices. #Receive a notification when overlay is restricted by IT admin Some device users may experience an issue where they are unable to view the camera preview window after triggering a scan. This issue can be caused by a restriction set by the IT admin and the organization's UEM policy. Previously, if the restriction was set, the user would simply not be able to see the preview window. In this release, the user will now get a notification asking them to contact their IT admin for more information.

Knox Capture v1.4 release notes. Support for additional non-rugged Samsung devices With Knox Capture v1.4, all Samsung devices running the ""Android - Secured by Knox"" platform and Android 12 or higher are supported. IMPORTANT - Due to hardware limitations, devices running the Legacy One UI Core platform are unsupported. Please refer to the Knox Capture supported devices list to verify whether your device model is supported. Enhanced performance for single scans With this release, single scan performance and camera launch times are improved across all supported devices. The number of single barcodes device users can scan per minute is significantly increased, and the camera scanner launches much faster. Added side key double press scan trigger Expanding the camera scan trigger options, IT admins and device users can now choose to launch the Knox Capture device scanner by pressing the side key, formerly known as the power or Bixby button, twice. This trigger option is designed for devices without an XCover key, and aims to improve Knox Capture usability for non-rugged devices. To learn more about the available trigger options and how to configure them, see Set the camera scan trigger. Added feature to send output data to a PC through Bluetooth Starting with v1.4, IT admins and device users can connect a Knox Capture-enabled device to a PC or other Bluetooth-enabled device. The device acts as a Human Interface Device (HID) keyboard when connected to a PC, emulating the functionality of a hardware scanner. For more information, see Configure the output path. New camera toggle option on scanning preview screen A camera toggle button is now available when the Knox Capture camera preview opens. Device users can tap the button to switch between the front-facing and rear cameras on the device, enhancing their scanning output and productivity. Usability improvements to in-app web links Previously, tapping on any link in the Knox Capture app opened it in the device's default browser. The app switching caused workflow disruptions and prevented users from quickly locating the information they needed. In v1.4, all in-app web links open in a web view instead of the browser, providing a seamless experience for users accessing support materials through the app. Back to release notes

Configure output path. Knox Capture can send scanned data to a Bluetooth-enabled device, like a PC, as a Human Interface Device (HID) keyboard, emulating the functionality of a hardware scanner. This feature is ideal for high-security enterprises with wireless network restrictions. For example, you might want to keep track of which assets are checked in or out of a restricted facility. In that case, you can use Knox Capture to scan an asset tag and send its data directly to a PC through Bluetooth. How it works The following describes how connected devices and scanned data are handled when using Knox Capture's Bluetooth wedge functionality: If the device is connected to a PC, output data is entered at the location of the keyboard cursor. Knox Capture applies any basic and advanced data formatting rules set in the default scanning profile to the output data. Only one Bluetooth-enabled device can be connected at a time. To connect to another device, you must first disconnect the current one. Scanning profiles are not supported, as Knox Capture operates as an HID keyboard. Connect a device To connect your device to a PC or other Bluetooth-enabled device using Knox Capture: 1. On the home screen, next to Profiles, tap the more actions menu icon. 2. Select Output path. 3. Under Bluetooth, toggle Use bluetooth wedge to the on position. 4. Under Paired devices, tap Make this device discoverable. To avoid unexpected scanning or output behavior, ensure you use Make this device discoverable instead of the Bluetooth menu in the device's settings. 5. If Bluetooth is disabled on your device, you're prompted to enable it. Then, Knox Capture asks for permission to make your device visible to others. Tap Allow. 6. Select a device to pair with. A status message confirms that the two devices are connected. A notification will alert you that the HID service is running. Any scanned data is then sent to the paired device through Bluetooth. Unpair a device To unpair a device through Knox Capture: 1. On the home screen, next to Profiles, tap the three dots. 2. Select Output path. 3. Under Paired devices, tap the gear next to the device you want to unpair. The device will be unpaired and removed from the Paired devices list.

. When connecting the keyboard, they would see a prompt asking if they wanted to use the USB keyboard for scanning purposes, even though they may not be using Knox Capture at the time. This release improves the prompt so that it only shows when Knox Capture is being used in the foreground. The device user must grant system permissions for connected devices in order for the prompt to display. If no permissions are granted, the prompt will not display on any screen. #Seamlessly switch between multiple paired devices in Output path If a user is paired with multiple devices in Knox Capture's Output path, they can now switch between each of their paired devices more easily. Previously, if a user had two paired devices in Output path, and Knox Capture was connected to _device A_, the user would first have to disconnect from _device A_ before connecting to _device B_. With this release, the user simply has to connect to _device B_. Knox Capture automatically disconnects from any previously paired devices

. Then, Knox Capture asks for permission to make your device visible to others. Tap Allow. 6. Select a device to pair with. A status message confirms that the two devices are connected. A notification will alert you that the HID service is running. Any scanned data is then sent to the paired device through Bluetooth. Unpair a device To unpair a device through Knox Capture: 1. On the home screen, next to Profiles, tap the three dots. 2. Select Output path. 3. Under Paired devices, tap the gear next to the device you want to unpair. The device will be unpaired and removed from the Paired devices list.

. Now, in Single scan preferences, you can turn on Continuous scanning to scan back-to-back barcodes without relaunching the camera preview after every scan. This feature maximizes worker efficiency when used with a Bluetooth wedge or the scanner overlay. Improvements to configuration behavior after profile mode change With this release, if a Knox Capture profile is pushed to a device in Admin mode through a UEM, the device enters Managed mode and removes any configurations previously applied in Admin mode. For example, consider a device user who's conducting practice scans in Admin mode. Upon receiving a profile configuration, a notification on the device confirms that the configuration updated, and Knox Capture automatically turns off test mode and clears the test results. PDF417 barcode support for default profiles Starting with Knox Capture v1.5, default profiles now include the PDF417 barcode type",510

Knox Capture v1.5 release notes. Scanner overlay Starting with Knox Capture v1.5, a scanner overlay is available. This overlay appears as a scanner preview over business apps, and enables device users to immediately see scanned data entered into an app field. Functionally, the scanner overlay works much like the full-screen scanner. When the device user aims the camera at the barcode, Knox Capture then sends the scanned data to the business app depending on whether single scan or multi-scan mode is enabled, and how Barcode selection is configured. See Use the scanner overlay to learn more. Continuous scanning for single scan mode Previously, when device users scanned single barcodes, the camera preview turned on before each scan, then off again once the scan was completed. Now, in Single scan preferences, you can turn on Continuous scanning to scan back-to-back barcodes without relaunching the camera preview after every scan. This feature maximizes worker efficiency when used with a Bluetooth wedge or the scanner overlay.

Overview. Get started with the basics by learning what Knox Capture is and how it works. What is Knox Capture? To help explain what Knox Capture does, it may be helpful to start with an understanding of what a *wedge* scanner is, and how it relates to the Knox Capture solution. In traditional hardware-based barcode scanning terminology, a wedge scanner is a physical device that attaches between a keyboard and a computer. The keyboard attaches to the scanner, and the scanner attaches to the computer. From the computer's perspective, the scanner behaves just like an additional keyboard. When the computer runs a software program (like an inventory spreadsheet app), and barcodes are read using the wedge scanner, data is sent from the scanner to the program in the form of keystrokes. From the program's point of view, data appears exactly as if someone had typed it manually using a keyboard. How Knox Capture works In a similar way, Knox Capture also acts as a wedge between a software program and keyboard",157

Configure output path. Knox Capture can send scanned data to a Bluetooth-enabled device, like a PC, as a Human Interface Device (HID) keyboard, emulating the functionality of a hardware scanner. This feature is ideal for high-security enterprises with wireless network restrictions. For example, you might want to keep track of which assets are checked in or out of a restricted facility. In that case, you can use Knox Capture to scan an asset tag and send its data directly to a PC through Bluetooth. How it works The following describes how connected devices and scanned data are handled when using Knox Capture's Bluetooth wedge functionality: If the device is connected to a PC, output data is entered at the location of the keyboard cursor. Knox Capture applies any basic and advanced data formatting rules set in the default scanning profile to the output data. Only one Bluetooth-enabled device can be connected at a time. To connect to another device, you must first disconnect the current one. Scanning profiles are not supported, as Knox Capture operates as an HID keyboard. Connect a device To connect your device to a PC or other Bluetooth-enabled device using Knox Capture: 1. On the home screen, next to Profiles, tap the more actions menu icon. 2. Select Output path. 3. Under Bluetooth, toggle Use bluetooth wedge to the on position. 4. Under Paired devices, tap Make this device discoverable. To avoid unexpected scanning or output behavior, ensure you use Make this device discoverable instead of the Bluetooth menu in the device's settings. 5. If Bluetooth is disabled on your device, you're prompted to enable it. Then, Knox Capture asks for permission to make your device visible to others. Tap Allow. 6. Select a device to pair with. A status message confirms that the two devices are connected. A notification will alert you that the HID service is running. Any scanned data is then sent to the paired device through Bluetooth. Unpair a device To unpair a device through Knox Capture: 1. On the home screen, next to Profiles, tap the three dots. 2. Select Output path. 3. Under Paired devices, tap the gear next to the device you want to unpair. The device will be unpaired and removed from the Paired devices list.",243
How can an enterprise determine if Knox Capture is an appropriate app for their needs?,"An enterprise can determine if it is an appropriate app for their need if an IT admin is required to configure Knox Capture for business apps and it is best paired with an EMM for deployment, configuration, and license activation."," If the administrator mode is turned on, Knox Capture can help determine if it's a good fit for an enterprise by allowing the IT admin to:

1. Create scanning profiles to test different configurations for launching the scanner, scanning different barcode types, and formatting the output data. 

2. Test the scanning profiles with different business apps to ensure the apps can appropriately launch the scanner and receive scanned data as simulated keystrokes.

3. Once satisfied with the profiles, export the configuration and deploy through an EMM to end users in managed mode. 

The ability to thoroughly test and fine-tune scanning profiles with business apps should provide the information needed to evaluate if Knox Capture meets an organization's needs before full deployment.",1,1,6,1.0,0.9964656829833984,1,0,10.30177092552185,"How do I know if this app is right for my enterprise? . Knox Capture supports a variety of use cases, and works best when paired with an EMM for deployment, configuration, and license activation.

Overview. Get started with the basics by learning what Knox Capture is and how it works. What is Knox Capture? To help explain what Knox Capture does, it may be helpful to start with an understanding of what a *wedge* scanner is, and how it relates to the Knox Capture solution. In traditional hardware-based barcode scanning terminology, a wedge scanner is a physical device that attaches between a keyboard and a computer.

When the computer runs a software program (like an inventory spreadsheet app), and barcodes are read using the wedge scanner, data is sent from the scanner to the program in the form of keystrokes. From the program's point of view, data appears exactly as if someone had typed it manually using a keyboard. How Knox Capture works In a similar way, Knox Capture also acts as a wedge between a software program and keyboard. However, instead of being a physical scanning device, Knox Capture is a mobile solution built for compatible Android smartphones and tablets. Enterprise IT admins can either download the Knox Capture app from Google Play, or custom-build their own wedge scanner apps using the Knox Capture SDK (Software Development Kit). Once Knox Capture is installed and running on a device, it *wedges* between an application (for example, a business app used to track inventory) and the mobile device's on-screen keyboard. When an end-user launches their business app, they can simply tap an on-screen button or press a hardware button on their device to trigger a barcode scan using the device's camera. After the camera focuses on a barcode, Knox Capture translates the barcode data into keystrokes, which then get passed back to the business app for processing. From the business app's point of view, keystrokes coming from Knox Capture appear exactly as if a user had typed them from the device keyboard. Who can use Knox Capture? Knox Capture is designed for anyone who wants to turn their mobile device into a powerful barcode scanner. However, depending on whether it's being used by an admin or an end-user, its features vary significantly. #Admin mode (Default) When Knox Capture is downloaded from Google Play and installed on a compatible Android device - and a valid license key is activated - the app operates in its default Admin mode. This mode allows the device user - typically an enterprise IT admin - to utilize the full functionality of the app to primarily do the following: 1. Create scanning profiles that define which apps can launch the barcode scanner, which barcode types can be scanned (QR, Code 128, EAN8, etc.), and how scanned data is formatted (append Tab or Enter key, insert special characters before or after data, etc.). 2. Test scanning profiles to ensure that appropriate business apps can launch the scanner and receive data back as keystrokes. 3. Export profile settings as a configuration file, which can then be used by EMM/UEM administrators to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to end-user devices. #Managed mode After an IT admin uses their EMM/UEM to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to an end-user's device, the device launches the app in Managed mode. In Managed mode, Knox Capture functionality is greatly reduced. End-users can review their scanning profile settings and perform barcode scans using their business apps (as permitted by their scanning profile), however they can't make changes to their scanning profiles, export profile settings, or switch to Admin mode by activating a Knox Capture license. Admin mode is the default mode of operation for Knox Capture. The procedures described in this guide are targeted at an IT admin audience. Further reading #Getting started tutorials These tutorials provide a guided workflow for new admins and end-users. While they don't cover every setting or scenario when using Knox Capture, they do provide a good starting point for learning the app's basics

Export and deploy configuration. Knox Capture uses a simple EMM-based deployment model. You first need to export a scanning configuration as a .txt file, then use an EMM add the file to your app configuration to deploy Knox Capture as a managed-app to your end-users. Exporting a configuration Exporting and sharing a scan configuration enables other devices apply the configuration to their installation. #Export options An IT admin can use several methods to export the configuration: Save it as a file on the device. Email it as a file attachment. Use Nearby share to send to another IT admin's device, Generate a QR code that can be scanned by other IT admins. To share a configuration on a per-device basis, transfer the configuration using near-field communication (NFC) or with a QR code. #Launch the export menu Regardless of the export method selected, begin by tapping the Share button in the lower-right of the home page to launch the Share configuration menu. #Save as file To save the file: 1. Tap the Save icon in the Share configuration menu. 2. Enter a name and tap Done. Knox Capture saves the configuration within My Files > Downloads, and displays a success message. #Email file To email the configuration as a text file attachment with the default email program: 1. Tap the email icon within the Share configuration menu. 2. Knox Capture launches the email application and starts a new message with the configuration file attached. #Nearby share To share a configuration with another device using Nearby share: 1. Tap the Nearby icon within the Share configuration menu. 2. Ensure Nearby Share is turned on for both the transmitting and receiving devices. 3. On the receiving device, tap the Device nearby is sharing popup that appears. #QR code To generate a QR code that can be scanned by other devices to import the configuration, tap the QR code option in the Share configuration menu. Knox Capture generates and displays a QR code. Optionally save or email the QR code by tapping either the Save or Email button. Tap Save to save the QR code as an image within the device My Files > Downloads folder. Tap Email to launch the default email app. The resulting email message includes instructions for importing the configuration using the QR code. If the configuration is too large for one QR code, Knox Capture generates multiple QR codes in a PDF file. The end user must scan them all to complete the import process. Deploying through an EMM To deploy Knox Capture with a custom scanning configuration across a fleet of devices, set the scan configuration and use the EMM console to add it to Knox Capture's App Config in Managed Google Play. Doing so ensures devices that the app runs for end-users in Managed mode. Deployment varies depending on the EMM provider, but should resemble the following flow: 1. Install Knox Capture on an admin device, configure the app, and export the configuration as a text file. 2. Add the Knox Capture app to your Managed Google Play Store. 3. Assign the app to a group or organization and launch the app configuration dialog. In most consoles, the app configuration (or App Config) dialog opens as a pop-up window or modal. 4. Activate your license in the EMM. 5. Copy and paste the text of the exported Knox Capture configuration into the provided configuration field. 6. Save the updated settings and deploy. If you do not add a configuration for Knox Capture in Managed Google Play when updating a license key, the app operates according to its _previous_ configuration. For example, a device with an existing scan configuration will continue to operate in Managed mode after updating the license key. However, a new device without an existing configuration will operate in Admin mode. To ensure _all_ devices operate in Managed mode, prepare and include the configuration each time you add or modify the app within the EMM console. Sharing and importing configurations Once a configuration has been exported, it can be shared with other devices running the app in Admin mode

. Scanned raw - The scanned barcode data in hexadecimal format without any keystroke output rules applied. 7. Inspect and compare the Scanned data to the Output data to ensure you've set the correct keystroke output rules. Repeat this test with other apps as required. 8. Exit test mode tapping X in the top-right corner of the test overlay, then in the confirmation pop-up, tap Close to return to the Test apps list. Step 6: Export configuration After editing your profiles, you can export the configuration as a .txt file. This configuration file can be shared with other Knox Capture IT admins, or it can be used in your EMM/UEM to deploy Knox Capture as a managed-app to end-users. To export a scanning configuration: 1. On the home screen, tap the Share button in the lower-right corner. 2. In the pop-up, seelct Email, then select your preferred email app. The configuration file is automatically attached. 3. After sending the email with the configuration file attached, re-launch Knox Capture. You should see a notification confirming the email submission followed by the date and time. Step 7: Deploy Knox Capture using an EMM/UEM You have now configured a basic Knox Capture configuration and exported it as an email attachment. The only thing left to do is use the configuration to deploy Knox Capture as a managed-app to your end-users. Actual deployment steps vary depending on the EMM provider, but they should generally resemble the following: 1. Add the Knox Capture app to your Managed Google Play Store. 2. Assign the app to a group or organization and launch the app configuration dialog. In a typical console, the app configuration dialog opens as a pop-up window or modal. 3. Activate the license by pasting it into the field within the app configuration (App Config) screen. 4. Copy and paste the exported configuration into the provided app configuration field. Adding a configuration to Managed Google Play is the only step necessary to ensure all devices installing the app operate in Managed mode. However, if you're using a trial version of Knox Capture, you'll need to push a Knox Suite license key as well. Refer to the following table for details on the configuration data: Configuration key , Configuration type , Configuration value - , - , - smartscan_license , String , Knox license key smartscan_config , String , Exported configuration data from Knox Capture 5.

Overview. Get started with the basics by learning what Knox Capture is and how it works. What is Knox Capture? To help explain what Knox Capture does, it may be helpful to start with an understanding of what a *wedge* scanner is, and how it relates to the Knox Capture solution. In traditional hardware-based barcode scanning terminology, a wedge scanner is a physical device that attaches between a keyboard and a computer. The keyboard attaches to the scanner, and the scanner attaches to the computer. From the computer's perspective, the scanner behaves just like an additional keyboard. When the computer runs a software program (like an inventory spreadsheet app), and barcodes are read using the wedge scanner, data is sent from the scanner to the program in the form of keystrokes. From the program's point of view, data appears exactly as if someone had typed it manually using a keyboard. How Knox Capture works In a similar way, Knox Capture also acts as a wedge between a software program and keyboard

Overview. Get started with the basics by learning what Knox Capture is and how it works. What is Knox Capture? To help explain what Knox Capture does, it may be helpful to start with an understanding of what a *wedge* scanner is, and how it relates to the Knox Capture solution. In traditional hardware-based barcode scanning terminology, a wedge scanner is a physical device that attaches between a keyboard and a computer. The keyboard attaches to the scanner, and the scanner attaches to the computer. From the computer's perspective, the scanner behaves just like an additional keyboard. When the computer runs a software program (like an inventory spreadsheet app), and barcodes are read using the wedge scanner, data is sent from the scanner to the program in the form of keystrokes. From the program's point of view, data appears exactly as if someone had typed it manually using a keyboard. How Knox Capture works In a similar way, Knox Capture also acts as a wedge between a software program and keyboard. However, instead of being a physical scanning device, Knox Capture is a mobile solution built for compatible Android smartphones and tablets. Enterprise IT admins can either download the Knox Capture app from Google Play, or custom-build their own wedge scanner apps using the Knox Capture SDK (Software Development Kit). Once Knox Capture is installed and running on a device, it *wedges* between an application (for example, a business app used to track inventory) and the mobile device's on-screen keyboard. When an end-user launches their business app, they can simply tap an on-screen button or press a hardware button on their device to trigger a barcode scan using the device's camera. After the camera focuses on a barcode, Knox Capture translates the barcode data into keystrokes, which then get passed back to the business app for processing. From the business app's point of view, keystrokes coming from Knox Capture appear exactly as if a user had typed them from the device keyboard. Who can use Knox Capture? Knox Capture is designed for anyone who wants to turn their mobile device into a powerful barcode scanner. However, depending on whether it's being used by an admin or an end-user, its features vary significantly. #Admin mode (Default) When Knox Capture is downloaded from Google Play and installed on a compatible Android device - and a valid license key is activated - the app operates in its default Admin mode. This mode allows the device user - typically an enterprise IT admin - to utilize the full functionality of the app to primarily do the following: 1. Create scanning profiles that define which apps can launch the barcode scanner, which barcode types can be scanned (QR, Code 128, EAN8, etc.), and how scanned data is formatted (append Tab or Enter key, insert special characters before or after data, etc.). 2. Test scanning profiles to ensure that appropriate business apps can launch the scanner and receive data back as keystrokes. 3. Export profile settings as a configuration file, which can then be used by EMM/UEM administrators to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to end-user devices. #Managed mode After an IT admin uses their EMM/UEM to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to an end-user's device, the device launches the app in Managed mode. In Managed mode, Knox Capture functionality is greatly reduced. End-users can review their scanning profile settings and perform barcode scans using their business apps (as permitted by their scanning profile), however they can't make changes to their scanning profiles, export profile settings, or switch to Admin mode by activating a Knox Capture license. Admin mode is the default mode of operation for Knox Capture. The procedures described in this guide are targeted at an IT admin audience. Further reading #Getting started tutorials These tutorials provide a guided workflow for new admins and end-users. While they don't cover every setting or scenario when using Knox Capture, they do provide a good starting point for learning the app's basics",372

. For example, ""abc"" will appear as ""abc"" in the test overlay. Non-printable ASCII control characters get embedded in curly brackets. For example, a Tab control character will appear as """" in the test overlay if sent as a string. ##Key event Printable and non-printable characters appear in their character representation embedded in angle brackets when sent as key events. For example, if sent as key events, the data `abHT` appears as `` in the test overlay. Example The following example applies test mode notation to scanned barcode data based on a small set of keystroke output rules. Barcode input: `abc\n123\teh` This input uses escape sequences for control characters. `\n` represents Enter and `\t` represents Tab. Keystroke output rules: Send Enter as String, Send Tab as Key event, Send ASCII Printable characters as String Test mode notation: Scanned data: `abc123eh`, Output : `abc123 eh`

Scan data is only partially sent to business app. Overview When sending longer barcode data as keystrokes from Knox Capture to a business app, only part of the data can be seen in the business app. Pre-condition This article assumes that the following conditions are met in your Knox Capture scanning profile: 1. Continuous scanning is enabled. This setting is disabled by default. 2. Keystroke output is configured to send scan data as Key events. By default, this value is set to String. Cause When Keystroke data is configured to send as a key event (rather than a string), the processing time is increased. After an internal timer counts down to zero, Knox Capture assumes that all scanned data was delivered successfully to the target field in the business app, and switches the focus back to the scanner overlay. The remaining undelivered data is then sent to the scanner overlay instead of the business app",385

What specific scanner engine settings and data processing rules can an IT admin modify when using the default scanning profile?,"When using the default scanning profile, IT admins can change the profile's scan engine settings and data processing rules, however they cannot change the default profile's apps and activities behaviour.","

An IT admin can modify the following scanner engine settings and data processing rules when using the default scanning profile:

- Barcode technologies (QR, Code 128, UPCA, etc.)
- Scanning methods (single barcode, multi barcode)  
- Camera behavior (enable flash, allow camera zoom)
- Appending a Tab key or Enter character to the end of each barcode
- Adding prefix or suffix characters to barcode data  
- Converting output to hex characters

For example, an IT admin can modify the default profile to append a Tab key at the end of each barcode, but they cannot change which apps can trigger the scanner.",1,1,6,1.0,0.999437153339386,1,0,19.67165231704712,". When using the default scanning profile, IT admins can change the profile's scan engine settings and data processing rules, however they cannot change the default profile's apps and activities behavior. For example, an IT admin can modify the default profile to append a Tab key at the end of each barcode, but they cannot change which apps can trigger the scanner. Custom scanning profiles While the default scanning profile allows Knox Capture to be used right away without any configuration, IT admins may want to use a custom profile to better suit their needs. With a custom profile, IT admins control which apps and activities can trigger a barcode scan. Any apps that you don't select in the custom profile will follow the default behavior in that the barcode scanner is active for all apps not specified in the custom profile. Creating custom scanning profiles Custom profiles can be created by modifying the default profile settings, or by creating entirely new profiles altogether. 1

Scanning profiles. Knox Capture acts as a wedge by translating barcode data into keystrokes that can be sent to a business application. But how does Knox Capture know what barcode types to scan, how to interpret scanned data, and which business applications to pass the data to? For Knox Capture, the *Scanning profile* defines the app's core behavior. A Scanning Profile is a configuration file that gets created or modified by an IT admin using the Knox Capture application. The profile defines how Knox Capture performs a barcode scan, and primarily consists of the following parameters: 1. Apps and activities - define which applications that can launch the Knox Capture scanner. 2. Scanner engine settings - specifying the barcode technologies (QR, Code 128, UPCA, etc.), scanning methods (single barcode, multi barcode), and camera behavior (enable flash, allow camera zoom). 3. Keystroke output rules - specifying how barcode data gets converted into keystrokes (append Tab or Enter character to each barcode, add prefix or suffix characters, convert output to hex characters, etc.) Default scanning profile Out-of-the-box, Knox Capture includes a default scanning profile that gets automatically associated with all apps on the device. In other words, when Knox Capture is launched, *any* app can trigger the camera scanner and receive barcode data in the form of keystrokes. This makes it easy to use Knox Capture for basic scanning purposes without any additional setup. When using the default scanning profile, IT admins can change the profile's scan engine settings and data processing rules, however they cannot change the default profile's apps and activities behavior. For example, an IT admin can modify the default profile to append a Tab key at the end of each barcode, but they cannot change which apps can trigger the scanner. Custom scanning profiles While the default scanning profile allows Knox Capture to be used right away without any configuration, IT admins may want to use a custom profile to better suit their needs. With a custom profile, IT admins control which apps and activities can trigger a barcode scan. Any apps that you don't select in the custom profile will follow the default behavior in that the barcode scanner is active for all apps not specified in the custom profile. Creating custom scanning profiles Custom profiles can be created by modifying the default profile settings, or by creating entirely new profiles altogether. 1. Tap the + button near the top of the app UI to open the profile creation options. 2. Select Create profile to start a profile from scratch, or select Duplicate existing profile to copy the settings from an existing (custom or default) profile. Alternatively, you can create a custom profile by clicking Create profile without clicking the + button. 3. Provide a profile name, then tap Done. The new profile appears in the profiles area below Defult scanning profile.

. Apps and activities - The component of every scanning profile that defines which busiess apps can launch the camera scanner. Learn how apps and activities work, and how you can customize them in the scanning profiles. Scan engine settings - These settings define how barcodes are scanned, and what happens with the data after each scan. Learn how to set barcode types, change scan modes, control viewfinder size, and more. Keystroke output - The scanning profile setting that defines how data is formatted after each successful scan. Learn how to append or prepend special characters to scanned data, or how to insert ASCII Tabs and Enter keys at the end of each barcode to allow for easier processing in spreadsheets and forms. Test mode - A feature that lets you test a scanning profile's apps, barcode types, and keystroke ouput rules before exporting the configuration for deployment

. If you create profiles for several applications and don't want the default profile's behavior to override any configurations, set the default profile to Off. The default profile setting is available on the Knox Capture main page. You can change the configuration at any time, export and deploy it to end users in Managed mode. If a profile is not active for an app or foreground activity and the end user attempts to scan a barcode, an error message is shown stating that the application does not support Knox Capture scanning. This setting cannot be changed in Managed mode. New floating button scan trigger !Hardware scan trigger setting !Hardware scan trigger setting A floating scan button is now available that launches the Knox Capture camera for scanning. By default, the scan button appears in the bottom right corner of the device's screen. Users can move it around the screen, and it remains in the last known position until it's toggled off. The scan button can be used in both Admin and Managed modes

. Now, in Single scan preferences, you can turn on Continuous scanning to scan back-to-back barcodes without relaunching the camera preview after every scan. This feature maximizes worker efficiency when used with a Bluetooth wedge or the scanner overlay. Improvements to configuration behavior after profile mode change With this release, if a Knox Capture profile is pushed to a device in Admin mode through a UEM, the device enters Managed mode and removes any configurations previously applied in Admin mode. For example, consider a device user who's conducting practice scans in Admin mode. Upon receiving a profile configuration, a notification on the device confirms that the configuration updated, and Knox Capture automatically turns off test mode and clears the test results.

Scanner engine settings - specifying the barcode technologies (QR, Code 128, UPCA, etc.), scanning methods (single barcode, multi barcode), and camera behavior (enable flash, allow camera zoom). 3. Keystroke output rules - specifying how barcode data gets converted into keystrokes (append Tab or Enter character to each barcode, add prefix or suffix characters, convert output to hex characters, etc.) Default scanning profile Out-of-the-box, Knox Capture includes a default scanning profile that gets automatically associated with all apps on the device. In other words, when Knox Capture is launched, *any* app can trigger the camera scanner and receive barcode data in the form of keystrokes. This makes it easy to use Knox Capture for basic scanning purposes without any additional setup. When using the default scanning profile, IT admins can change the profile's scan engine settings and data processing rules, however they cannot change the default profile's apps and activities behavior

Admin get started. The following tutorial is intended for IT admins, and guides you through the basics of Knox Capture using the default scanning profile as a starting point. Step 1: Download, install, and launch the app Knox Capture is available to download from Google Play. As mentioned in the Knox Capture Overview, the app runs in admin mode by default. End-users who wish to use Knox Capture must have the app deployed to their devices through an EMM/UEM. After installing and launching Knox Capture for the first time, it presents you with links to all of the applicable Terms, Conditions, and privacy policies. Review these, and if you agree to all of the documents, tap Agree. From the Knox Capture home screen, you can review or dismiss the in-app tips for new users, and access the Knox Capture options by tapping the menu button (three dots) near the top-right next to the search icon. Step 2: Edit the default profile Tap Default scanning profile to explore and edit the profile settings. Note that you cannot change the profile's App list, as the default scanning profile works with all apps on the device. Review Scanning profiles for more information. Step 3: Change scan engine settings On the Default scanning profile screen, tap Knox Capture in the Scanner field to view or change the scan engine settings. In this example, you'll learn how to: Update the profile's list of supported barcode types. Enable a flashlight button during a barcode scan. To change these scan engine settings: 1. Tap Barcode types, then scroll down to review the selected types. Upon creation, profiles automatically use Code 128, Code 39, DataMatrix, EAN8, Interleaved 2 of 5, QR, UPCA, and UPCE. Add or remove a barcode type of your choice. For best performance, only select the barcode types necessary when creating the profile. 2. Tap Save to return to the Scan engine settings screen. 3. Scroll down to Camera Settings, then enable the Flashlight button by moving the slider to the right. 4. Tap < Scan engine settings to return to the Default scanning profile screen. Step 4: Set keystroke output rules The last step in component of a Knox Capture profile keystroke output rules. In this example, you'll set rules to append an Enter keystroke to the scanned data. To do this: 1. Expand the Keystroke output options, then tap Send Enter character as. 2. In the pop-up, select Key event. This emulates a user hitting the Enter key on their keyboard after they type characters into a field. 3. Tap Save to return to the Keystroke output options. 4. Scroll down to Basic data formatting, then expand the options. 5. Enable the Append Enter character option by moving the slider to the right. 6. Tap < Default scanning profile to return to the home screen. Step 5: Test your profile After making the modifications to your profile, you can test your Knox Capture to ensure that your barcode types, flashlight, and keystroke output rules were configured properly. In this example, you'll use Samsung Internet to test the configuration. 1. On the home screen, tap the options icon in the top-right next to the search icon, then tap Test apps. After starting the test mode, a system pop-up notification indicates that Test mode is on. 2. Select the Samsung Internet app from the Test apps list, then tap Open. 3. Tap your browser's search field to bring up the device's on-screen keyboard. Tap the Knox Capture icon near the top-left side of the keyboard to trigger a scan. Optionally, if you are using a rugged device like an XCover Pro, trigger a scan with the Scan trigger hardware key. 4. Test the flashlight by tapping the button near the top-left corner of the screen. 5. Aim the camera at a barcode to scan. The barcode will automatically scan once in focus,unless the barcode wasn't selected in the profile. 6. Review the scanned data in the test overlay. You'll see the following values: Output - The processed data in test mode notation with keystroke output rules applied. Scanned - The scanned barcode data in test mode notation without any keystroke output rules applied

. Once the file has been shared, the receiving device can import the configuration by doing the following: Importing a configuration overrides existing Knox Capture settings on a device and is irreversible. 1. Tap the more actions menu icon within the home page to the right of the Profiles list label. Then select Import. 2. After launching the import configuration menu, acknowledge the warning message by tapping Confirm. 3. Find the configuration file to import. Knox Capture will import the configuration and display a success message: #Import with QR code If a configuration was shared via QR code, you can import the configuration by doing the following: 1. Tap the QR code icon within the import configuration menu to launch the camera scanner. 2. Direct the camera at the QR code. 3. After scanning the QR code, Knox Capture automatically imports the configuration and displays a success message. If the configuration is too large for one QR code, Knox Capture displays multiple QR codes in a PDF file. The end user must scan them all to complete the import process. If the user attempts to scan a QR code that isn't part of the same configuration, an error message is shown on the overlay until a different one is scanned.

Scanning profiles. Knox Capture acts as a wedge by translating barcode data into keystrokes that can be sent to a business application. But how does Knox Capture know what barcode types to scan, how to interpret scanned data, and which business applications to pass the data to? For Knox Capture, the *Scanning profile* defines the app's core behavior. A Scanning Profile is a configuration file that gets created or modified by an IT admin using the Knox Capture application. The profile defines how Knox Capture performs a barcode scan, and primarily consists of the following parameters: 1. Apps and activities - define which applications that can launch the Knox Capture scanner. 2. Scanner engine settings - specifying the barcode technologies (QR, Code 128, UPCA, etc.), scanning methods (single barcode, multi barcode), and camera behavior (enable flash, allow camera zoom). 3. Keystroke output rules - specifying how barcode data gets converted into keystrokes (append Tab or Enter character to each barcode, add prefix or suffix characters, convert output to hex characters, etc.) Default scanning profile Out-of-the-box, Knox Capture includes a default scanning profile that gets automatically associated with all apps on the device. In other words, when Knox Capture is launched, *any* app can trigger the camera scanner and receive barcode data in the form of keystrokes. This makes it easy to use Knox Capture for basic scanning purposes without any additional setup. When using the default scanning profile, IT admins can change the profile's scan engine settings and data processing rules, however they cannot change the default profile's apps and activities behavior. For example, an IT admin can modify the default profile to append a Tab key at the end of each barcode, but they cannot change which apps can trigger the scanner. Custom scanning profiles While the default scanning profile allows Knox Capture to be used right away without any configuration, IT admins may want to use a custom profile to better suit their needs. With a custom profile, IT admins control which apps and activities can trigger a barcode scan. Any apps that you don't select in the custom profile will follow the default behavior in that the barcode scanner is active for all apps not specified in the custom profile. Creating custom scanning profiles Custom profiles can be created by modifying the default profile settings, or by creating entirely new profiles altogether. 1. Tap the + button near the top of the app UI to open the profile creation options. 2. Select Create profile to start a profile from scratch, or select Duplicate existing profile to copy the settings from an existing (custom or default) profile. Alternatively, you can create a custom profile by clicking Create profile without clicking the + button. 3. Provide a profile name, then tap Done. The new profile appears in the profiles area below Defult scanning profile.

. Once the file has been shared, the receiving device can import the configuration by doing the following: Importing a configuration overrides existing Knox Capture settings on a device and is irreversible. 1. Tap the more actions menu icon within the home page to the right of the Profiles list label. Then select Import. 2. After launching the import configuration menu, acknowledge the warning message by tapping Confirm. 3. Find the configuration file to import. Knox Capture will import the configuration and display a success message: #Import with QR code If a configuration was shared via QR code, you can import the configuration by doing the following: 1. Tap the QR code icon within the import configuration menu to launch the camera scanner. 2. Direct the camera at the QR code. 3. After scanning the QR code, Knox Capture automatically imports the configuration and displays a success message. If the configuration is too large for one QR code, Knox Capture displays multiple QR codes in a PDF file",183

How can a business app developer edit the AndroidManifest.xml file of their app so it can receive and parse scanned data sent from Knox Capture via an intent object?,A business app developer must edit their AndroidManifest.xml file by adding an intent filter for the action that the Knox Capture administrator has set in the Knox Capture policy.," The business app developer needs to edit the AndroidManifest.xml file to define the package name, intent action and category to set up Knox Capture to send the correct intent output to their app. 

Specifically, in the AndroidManifest.xml file, they should:

1. Define the package name to match their business app 
2. Specify the intent filter information (intent action and category) to match what their app uses to receive intents 
3. Replace any dummy strings with values relevant to their app

For example:

```
PackageName = applicationId ""com.test.smartscan"" 

AndroidManifest.xml

If using an activity to receive the intent:

<intent-filter>
    <action android:name=""intent.action.activity""/> 
    <category android:name=""android.intent.category.DEFAULT""/>
</intent-filter>

If using a broadcast receiver: 

<intent-filter>
    <action android:name=""myApp.intent.action.MY_ACTION""/>
</intent-filter> 
```

Properly defining this manifest information ensures Knox Capture delivers the intent to the business app after each successful scan.",1,2,6,0.5,0.999868631362915,1,0,19.962554931640625,". For business app developers #Edit the AndroidManifest.xml file For your business app to parse the scanned data, you need to set up Knox Capture to send it the correct intent output. To do so, edit AndroidManifest.xml to define the package name, intent action and category. Knox Capture offers three different methods for your app to receive an Android intent. Refer to Intent output settings for more details. The following is a snippet demonstrating the manifest information to edit. Ensure you replace any dummy strings with ones relevant to your app. ``` PackageName = applicationId ""com.test.smartscan"" AndroidManifest.xml ``` If you're using an activity to receive the intent: ``` ``` If you're using the foreground service to receive the intent: ``` ``` If you're using the broadcast receiver to receive the intent: ``` ``` Properly defining the intent filter information ensures that after each successful scan, Knox Capture delivers the intent to your business app through the chosen method

Use intent output. If your business app needs to obtain scanned data programmatically (for example, to process it further in-app), Knox Capture can pass the data within an Android intent object instead of through keystroke output. You can also enable intent output to work with keystroke output. For example, if you select Send via startActivity as your intent delivery method, Knox Capture first sends keystrokes to the foreground activity, then sends the intent to the new activity instance. To use Knox Capture's intent output feature: Business app developers must ensure the business app receives the intent, and, IT admins must configure Knox Capture's Intent output feature accordingly.

. Intent action - `intent.action.activity`, Intent category - `intent.category.DEFAULT`, Intent delivery - `Send via startActivity`, Component information - `test.smartscan` For Knox Capture admins To set up intent output: 1. On the Knox Capture home screen, tap on the profile you want to set intent output for. 2. Under Intent output, tap Select app packages. 3. Select the apps for intent output, then tap < in the top left to return to the previous screen. Make sure the package name matches your business app. 4. Under Intent output, specify an Intent action, Intent category, and Intent delivery method to handle the intent. Intent action and category - The intent filter information matching the business app's intent filter information. For example, if `IntentOutputActivity` is receiving the intent, Knox Capture needs to configure the action as `intent.action.activity` and the category as `android.intent.category.DEFAULT`. Intent delivery - The app activity that handles the intent-based data. Refer to Intent output settings for descriptions of each activity. For more details on how to find the intent filter information, see Edit the AndroidManifest.xml file. At any time, change the apps designated for intent output by tapping Manage app packages under Intent output. Intent output settings Refer to the following settings to configure an Android intent: The intent action and category must match the ones defined in your business app's `AndroidManifest.xml` file, under a component's `intent-filter` element. For detailed instructions, contact the developers of the app. Application package name - Selects one or more apps to receive the intent. Intent action - Designates an action to handle the intent. Intent category - Sets the category of the intent action. Intent delivery - Selects one of three delivery methods for intent-based data: 1. Send via startActivity - Launches the activity to pass data through. 2. Send via startForeground - Creates a foreground service from an activity or app component to pass data through. This option is only available for devices running Android 8 and above. 3. Broadcast Intent - Gives the business app's broadcast receiver foreground priority on the device to speed up data delivery. Use this delivery method only if you're experiencing delays when sending scanned data immediately after the device is booted. After you configure an Android intent, the intent delivery method is added to the blue test overlay in Test mode. Refer to Use test mode for steps on how to check your configuration.

The following example demonstrates how the IT admin should configure Knox Capture if the intent is received when starting a new activity

Configure apps and activities. Each Knox Capture profile supports a set of apps to which its scanner and keystroke output settings apply. IT admins can set more refined control over each scanning context within an app by associating individual Android activities with different Knox Capture profiles. A user interacts with an Android activity within an app's UI, such as a user data form or search input. Refer to the Android developer documentation for more information about activities. Depending on deployment requirements, consider configuring one profile for all apps. Or, set up a unique profile for each device app. Or, associate a group of apps or activities with one profile. For example, within the *same* app, consider associating: A user data form with one profile that appends a Tab key event to scanned data, A search input field with a profile that appends an Enter key event A single profile can have numerous apps or activities, but a single activity can only belong to one profile",1047

Inspect and compare the Scanned data to the Output value to verify the correct keystroke output rules and scanning settings for the activity in question. 6. Repeat for each app included in the configuration as required. After testing an app, there should be a green check mark badge next to the app logo on the Test apps screen. Use this to track testing progress. 7. Tap All activities under an app to open a list of app activities that are included in the profile you're testing. Here, you can check if individual activities were tested. If so, a green checkmark appears next to the activity. 8. Clear all the check marks by tapping the additional actions menu icon at the upper-right of the Test apps screen and selecting Clear test activity. Exit test mode Exit test mode in one of the following ways: Toggle Test mode to the off position on the Test apps screen. Tap the X in upper-right corner of the test overlay, then tap Exit to confirm. In addition to the two points mentioned above, the user can also exit test mode from the notification panel. Test mode notation Test mode uses special notation when displaying scanned data in the test overlay to verify the keystroke output rules are set up correctly. #Character representation , Printable ASCII or Unicode characters are represented in their native printable format. For example, ""abc123"" appears as ""abc123"" in the test overlay. Non-printable ASCII control characters are represented with standard abbreviation. For example, a Tab control character appears as ""HT"" in the test overlay

Configure keystroke output and data formatting. Knox Capture sends scanned data to business apps as keystrokes, imitating the way a user manually enters data using a keyboard. If you activate a KPE (Knox Platform for Enterprise) Premium license with a Galaxy S20 device in WP-C mode, you must set `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` to True in your EMM. Enabling this policy allows keystroke output to function as expected. Keystroke output Refer to the following settings to modify scanned data and format its output: Setting Description Options Default Send Enter character as Sets the output format for all existing and appended Enters Key event &mdash; Sends Enter as a key event. String &mdash; Sends Enter as ASCII Line Feed 0x0A. Both String and Key event &mdash; Sends Enter as ASCII Line Feed 0x0A and key event. None &mdash; Sends no output for Enter. None Send Tab character as Sets the output format for all existing and appended Tabs Key event &mdash; Sends Tab as a key event. String &mdash; Sends Tab as ASCII Horizontal Tab 0x09. Both String and Key event &mdash; Sends Tab as ASCII Horizontal Tab 0x09 and key event. None &mdash; Sends no output for Tab. None Send Carriage Return character as Sets the output format for all Carriage Returns Key event &mdash; Sends Carriage Return as a key event. String &mdash; Sends Carriage Return as ASCII Carriage Return 0x0D. Both String and Key event &mdash; Sends Carriage Return as ASCII Carriage Return 0x0D and key event. None &mdash; Sends no output for Carriage Return. None Send ASCII Control characters as Sets the output format for ASCII characters 1-31 Key event &mdash; Sends ASCII codes 1 through 31 as key events String &mdash; Sends ASCII codes 1 through 31 as strings. Both String and Key event &mdash; Sends ASCII control characters in both string and key event formats. None &mdash; Sends no output for ASCII control characters. String Send ASCII Printable characters as Sets the output format for ASCII characters 32-126 Key event &mdash; Sends ASCII characters 32-126 as key events. This is useful when a text input field, like a password input, requires key events for validation and does not accept pasted strings. String &mdash; Sends ASCII printable characters as strings. Both String and Key event &mdash; Sends ASCII printable characters as both strings and key events. None &mdash; Sends no output for ASCII printable characters. String Key event delay Sets the delay in milliseconds that Knox Capture will wait before sending a key event like Tab. Key events transmit slower than string data, which can cause synchronization problems. If your barcode output is partially cut off, try increasing the key event delay to a higher value. [0, Int32 max value] 0 Basic data formatting Refer to the following basic data formatting information to create rules to add prefixes, suffixes, and append Tab or Enter characters to scanned barcode data before output. If appending a Tab or Enter key to the data output, you must also select an output option in the Send Tab as or Sent Enter as settings above. Setting , Description , Default - , - , - Prefix to data , Prepends a string of characters to the beginning of the scanned data. None Suffix to data , Appends a string of characters to the end of the scanned data. None Append Tab characte , Appends a Tab (ASCII Horizontal Tab character, 0x09) to the end of the scanned barcode data to automate actions like moving to the adjacent cell in a spreadsheet. OFF Append Enter characte , Appends an Enter (ASCII Line Feed character, 0x0A) to the end of the scanned barcode data to automate actions like submitting a form. OFF Send as Hex , Sends the data in hexadecimal format. OFF Advanced data formatting In Knox Capture, you can add one or more rules that modify data based on certain actions and criteria. These rules convert scanned data into various formats, which are then passed to business apps through keystrokes. To create a rule and configure its actions and criteria: 1

Use intent output. If your business app needs to obtain scanned data programmatically (for example, to process it further in-app), Knox Capture can pass the data within an Android intent object instead of through keystroke output. You can also enable intent output to work with keystroke output. For example, if you select Send via startActivity as your intent delivery method, Knox Capture first sends keystrokes to the foreground activity, then sends the intent to the new activity instance. To use Knox Capture's intent output feature: Business app developers must ensure the business app receives the intent, and, IT admins must configure Knox Capture's Intent output feature accordingly.

Use scanner overlay. The Scanner overlay feature lets device users view the camera preview window and the business app screen concurrently. When the user triggers a barcode scan, a mini camera preview is shown over the business app screen as a picture-in-picture (PiP) window, allowing users to use the scanner and view their app's data at the same time. Functionally, the Scanner overlay behaves just like the normal scanner. When the device user aims the camera at the barcode, Knox Capture sends the scanned data to the business app depending on how the scan engine settings are configured. Enable the Scanner overlay The Scanner overlay can be enabled in both Admin and Managed modes. To enable this feature, go to the Knox Capture home screen, tap the Options button (three dots), tap Scanner overlay, then toggle the feature On.

Scanning overlay doesn't appear when launching the camera. Overview Some device users experience an issue where they are unable to view the scanner overlay after launching the device's camera for use as a scanner. Cause The issue occurs when the Android Enterprise policy that controls the DISALLOW_CREATE_WINDOWS boolean sets it to true. This boolean specifies whether or not apps can open secondary windows. By default, the value of this boolean is false, allowing apps like Knox Capture to create a window for the scanner overlay every time the camera launches. If a device policy sets this boolean to true, then Knox Capture won't be able to create the scanner overlay window when the camera launches. Resolution Ensure that the policy in your UEM profile that controls this value sets it to the equivalent of false. For Knox Manage customers, set the Create Window policy to Allow. For all other UEMs, refer to their documentation on Android Enterprise policies.

In this release, your users can now scan inverted-color barcodes on all available barcode types. To learn how to use this feature, see Configure scan engine settings. #Support for QR code license scanning To help speed up the license activation workflow for end-users, you can now generate a Knox Suite license as a QR code, then have end-users scan that QR code to automatically enter the license key in their app. Knox Capture does not generate a QR code for you. #Knox Capture SDK v1.1.0 This release of Knox Capture v1.9 also introduces a new version of the Knox Capture SDK for customers who wish to develop their own custom scanning applications. SDK v1.1

Configure scan engine settings. Scan engine settings define the core Knox Capture behavior, such as how barcodes are scanned, and what happens with the data after each scan. The following settings are available: Barcode types Choose the barcode symbologies the scanner should recognize. For example, Code 39, and QR code. Available barcode types: Type , Options - , - Numeric-only (1D) , Codabar, EAN13, EAN8, Interleaved 2 of 5, UPCA, UPCE Alphanumeric (1D) , Code 128, Code 39, Code 93 2D , Data Matrix, PDF417, QR Every barcode except Codabar and Code 93 is enabled by default. Scanning settings Use scan settings to define how barcodes are scanned, selected, and parsed before Knox Capture sends them to a target business application. #Scan mode Sets the primary capture mode for scanning. Available options: Setting , Option - , - Single scan (default) , Scans and parses one barcode at a time. Multi scan , Detects multiple barcodes in the scan area at the same time

. Zoom factor Any value from 1.0 (no zoom) to 4.0 (fully zoomed in). Default value is 1.0. 2 Flashlight Auto is not available in Knox Capture: Scandit Edition.

. PDF417 barcode support for default profiles Starting with Knox Capture v1.5, default profiles now include the PDF417 barcode type. The current barcode symbologies enabled in the default profile are: Code 128, QR, Code 39, EAN8, EAN13/UPCA, UPCE, Interleaved 2 of 5, Data Matrix, PDF417 Back to release notes

. 2. Scanner engine settings - specifying the barcode technologies (QR, Code 128, UPCA, etc.), scanning methods (single barcode, multi barcode), and camera behavior (enable flash, allow camera zoom). 3. Keystroke output rules - specifying how barcode data gets converted into keystrokes (append Tab or Enter character to each barcode, add prefix or suffix characters, convert output to hex characters, etc.) Default scanning profile Out-of-the-box, Knox Capture includes a default scanning profile that gets automatically associated with all apps on the device. In other words, when Knox Capture is launched, *any* app can trigger the camera scanner and receive barcode data in the form of keystrokes. This makes it easy to use Knox Capture for basic scanning purposes without any additional setup. When using the default scanning profile, IT admins can change the profile's scan engine settings and data processing rules, however they cannot change the default profile's apps and activities behavior

If the ""Remove leading UPCA zero"" and ""Return as UPCA"" settings are both enabled, enabling ""Remove leading UPCA zero"" will remove the leading zero digit from scanned barcode data that is then transformed into its UPCA representation, before being sent to the target business application. So scanned UPCE barcodes will first be converted to UPCA, and then have the leading zero digit removed from the UPCA data, if present.",1,1,6,1.0,0.9998756647109985,1,0,5.720751523971558,".

Out-of-range barcode still scanned successfully by Knox Capture. Overview For example, assuming you've set a symbol count range of 7 - 20 for Code 128 barcodes, the following situations may occur: Code ""1234567"" (length 7) can be successfully scanned. Code ""12345678"" (length 8) can be successfully scanned. Code ""123456"" (length 6) can't be successfully scanned. Code ""12345"" (length 5) can be successfully scanned. This is unexpected behavior. Code ""1234"" (length 4) can't be successfully scanned. Cause When setting the scan length, there's a difference between the number of digits or characters and the active symbol count. The correlation between characters and symbol counts depends on the encoding standard. For instance, Code 128 differs from Code 39. For Code 128, there are three different encoding schemes that can be mixed within a single Code 128 barcode to achieve the shortest possible code. Resolution Check which encoding standards your barcode data follows.

. Change this property to include lengths not enabled by default, or to optimize decoding performance for a certain number of symbols. Character-to-symbol mapping depends on barcode type. For example, some barcodes include additional checksum characters in their symbol counts. For more information on active symbol count, refer to Configure the Active Symbol Count. Depends on barcode type. Max. length Determines the maximum supported barcode length (active symbol count) to decode. Depends on barcode type.

Added side key double press scan trigger Expanding the camera scan trigger options, IT admins and device users can now choose to launch the Knox Capture device scanner by pressing the side key, formerly known as the power or Bixby button, twice. This trigger option is designed for devices without an XCover key, and aims to improve Knox Capture usability for non-rugged devices. To learn more about the available trigger options and how to configure them, see Set the camera scan trigger. Added feature to send output data to a PC through Bluetooth Starting with v1.4, IT admins and device users can connect a Knox Capture-enabled device to a PC or other Bluetooth-enabled device. The device acts as a Human Interface Device (HID) keyboard when connected to a PC, emulating the functionality of a hardware scanner. For more information, see Configure the output path. New camera toggle option on scanning preview screen A camera toggle button is now available when the Knox Capture camera preview opens

Knox Capture v1.2 release notes. This Knox Capture v1.2 release, scheduled to go live on July 30, 2021, includes several new features and improvements to existing functionality. Starting with Knox Capture v1.2, devices running an Android version lower than 11 (R) are not supported. On these devices, downloading Knox Capture from the Google Play store installs v1.1 instead. All customers should upgrade devices to Android 11 (R) OS binary before v1.2 can be downloaded. Expanded device support In Knox Capture v1.2, support is added for the following devices: Galaxy XCover 4S, Galaxy Tab Active Pro, Galaxy S20, Galaxy S21 Only the keyboard scan icon and floating scan button are supported on non-rugged devices (S20 and S21). For a full list of supported devices, see Supported devices. Keystroke output support in WP-C deployments In previous Knox Capture versions, if an IT admin activated a KPE Premium license with a WP-C deployment, remote injection was blocked in WP-C mode. As a workaround, `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` must be set to True to support keystroke output. With this release, keystroke output in WP-C deployments is supported regardless of whether `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` is set to True. Keystroke output support is not yet available for Galaxy S20 devices. You must use the aforementioned workaround to use keystroke output on Galaxy S20 devices. Option to disable default profile IT admins can now enable or disable the default profile. If you create profiles for several applications and don't want the default profile's behavior to override any configurations, set the default profile to Off. The default profile setting is available on the Knox Capture main page. You can change the configuration at any time, export and deploy it to end users in Managed mode. If a profile is not active for an app or foreground activity and the end user attempts to scan a barcode, an error message is shown stating that the application does not support Knox Capture scanning. This setting cannot be changed in Managed mode. New floating button scan trigger !Hardware scan trigger setting !Hardware scan trigger setting A floating scan button is now available that launches the Knox Capture camera for scanning. By default, the scan button appears in the bottom right corner of the device's screen. Users can move it around the screen, and it remains in the last known position until it's toggled off. The scan button can be used in both Admin and Managed modes. See Set camera trigger for more information on the various available triggers. License activation menu for unmanaged devices Previously, Knox Capture licenses could only be used by organizations pushing them through an MDM. Starting from Knox Capture v1.2, IT admins can now activate Knox Capture licenses in-app using the new license activation menu. To deactivate an entered license key, uninstall the Knox Capture app from your device. The license activation menu is only available in Admin mode. For more information, see Activate your license. Support for exporting large configurations through QR code !Multiple QR code export This Knox Capture version extends the QR code export functionality to support larger configurations. Prior to v1.2, IT admins couldn't select QR code as the export method if the configuration size was too large. Now, multiple QR codes are generated in a PDF file for the end user to scan. The device prompts the user to scan them all before the configuration can be successfully imported to Knox Capture. To learn more, see Export a scanning configuration and Import a scanning configuration. Persistent scan sessions IT admins and end users can now pick up calls, switch apps, and clear tasks during scan sessions without losing scanned data. Rebooting the device has no impact on saved scan data. In multi-scan sessions where the user leaves the business app and returns, they are prompted to either continue the original scan session or begin a new one

Knox Capture v1.4 release notes. Support for additional non-rugged Samsung devices With Knox Capture v1.4, all Samsung devices running the ""Android - Secured by Knox"" platform and Android 12 or higher are supported. IMPORTANT - Due to hardware limitations, devices running the Legacy One UI Core platform are unsupported.

Knox Capture v1.1 release notes. Landscape mode support With this new update, Knox Capture can now be used in landscape mode on all supported devices. Frontline workers can choose to scan barcodes or navigate the app UI in either portrait or landscape mode, allowing more robust scan capability. Added device model support Extending Knox Capture's device lineup, the Galaxy XCover 5 has been added to the list of supported devices in v1.1. Advanced data formatting With v1.1, custom rules can be configured to trigger or block actions based on a set of criteria. Advanced data formatting allows you to move the cursor, modify, send, or delay data sent to an input field. For example, you can create a rule to send only the last 4 digits of a barcode to a business app. For more information, refer to Advanced data formatting. Keyboard scan button input method A scan button has been added to the device keyboard that launches the Knox Capture camera for scanning. On devices running OneUI 2

Knox Capture v1.8 release notes. New features Knox Capture v1.8 introduces the following new features: #Continuous single scan A new Continuous scanning option appears on the Scan engine settings > Single scan preferences screen. When this option is toggled On, device users can scan several barcodes in sequence - and have each scan be registered as a single event - without having to press the camera trigger button between each scan. To learn more about the Continuous scanning feature, see Single scan preferences. #Scanner overlay In this release, device users have the option to view the camera preview window as an overlay on top of their business app. When the Scanner overlay feature is enabled and a scan is triggered, users will see a mini camera preview window on top of their existing business app screen. To learn more about this new feature, see Scanner overlay. #Inverse color barcode support This release adds a new Performance lab feature that allows users to scan inverse colored barcodes. This feature only works with Data Matrix and QR type barcodes in this release. To enable this option, go to the Knox Capture main screen, then tap the Options button (three dots), tap Performance lab, then enable Inverted color recognition. Enhancements Knox Capture v1.8 includes the following enhancements to existing features: #More intuitive user prompts when connecting USB device Previously, users would get a prompt even if Knox Capture wasn't running in the foreground. For example, a user might want to connect a USB keyboard for use in their business. When connecting the keyboard, they would see a prompt asking if they wanted to use the USB keyboard for scanning purposes, even though they may not be using Knox Capture at the time. This release improves the prompt so that it only shows when Knox Capture is being used in the foreground. The device user must grant system permissions for connected devices in order for the prompt to display. If no permissions are granted, the prompt will not display on any screen. #Seamlessly switch between multiple paired devices in Output path If a user is paired with multiple devices in Knox Capture's Output path, they can now switch between each of their paired devices more easily. Previously, if a user had two paired devices in Output path, and Knox Capture was connected to _device A_, the user would first have to disconnect from _device A_ before connecting to _device B_. With this release, the user simply has to connect to _device B_. Knox Capture automatically disconnects from any previously paired devices. #Receive a notification when overlay is restricted by IT admin Some device users may experience an issue where they are unable to view the camera preview window after triggering a scan. This issue can be caused by a restriction set by the IT admin and the organization's UEM policy. Previously, if the restriction was set, the user would simply not be able to see the preview window. In this release, the user will now get a notification asking them to contact their IT admin for more information. To learn more about the restriction, see the Knox Capture Knowledge Base Article (KBA) related to this issue. Back to release notes

Export and deploy configuration. Knox Capture uses a simple EMM-based deployment model. You first need to export a scanning configuration as a .txt file, then use an EMM add the file to your app configuration to deploy Knox Capture as a managed-app to your end-users. Exporting a configuration Exporting and sharing a scan configuration enables other devices apply the configuration to their installation. #Export options An IT admin can use several methods to export the configuration: Save it as a file on the device. Email it as a file attachment. Use Nearby share to send to another IT admin's device, Generate a QR code that can be scanned by other IT admins. To share a configuration on a per-device basis, transfer the configuration using near-field communication (NFC) or with a QR code. #Launch the export menu Regardless of the export method selected, begin by tapping the Share button in the lower-right of the home page to launch the Share configuration menu. #Save as file To save the file: 1. Tap the Save icon in the Share configuration menu. 2. Enter a name and tap Done. Knox Capture saves the configuration within My Files > Downloads, and displays a success message. #Email file To email the configuration as a text file attachment with the default email program: 1. Tap the email icon within the Share configuration menu. 2. Knox Capture launches the email application and starts a new message with the configuration file attached. #Nearby share To share a configuration with another device using Nearby share: 1. Tap the Nearby icon within the Share configuration menu. 2. Ensure Nearby Share is turned on for both the transmitting and receiving devices. 3. On the receiving device, tap the Device nearby is sharing popup that appears. #QR code To generate a QR code that can be scanned by other devices to import the configuration, tap the QR code option in the Share configuration menu. Knox Capture generates and displays a QR code. Optionally save or email the QR code by tapping either the Save or Email button. Tap Save to save the QR code as an image within the device My Files > Downloads folder. Tap Email to launch the default email app. The resulting email message includes instructions for importing the configuration using the QR code. If the configuration is too large for one QR code, Knox Capture generates multiple QR codes in a PDF file. The end user must scan them all to complete the import process. Deploying through an EMM To deploy Knox Capture with a custom scanning configuration across a fleet of devices, set the scan configuration and use the EMM console to add it to Knox Capture's App Config in Managed Google Play. Doing so ensures devices that the app runs for end-users in Managed mode. Deployment varies depending on the EMM provider, but should resemble the following flow: 1. Install Knox Capture on an admin device, configure the app, and export the configuration as a text file. 2. Add the Knox Capture app to your Managed Google Play Store. 3. Assign the app to a group or organization and launch the app configuration dialog. In most consoles, the app configuration (or App Config) dialog opens as a pop-up window or modal. 4. Activate your license in the EMM. 5. Copy and paste the text of the exported Knox Capture configuration into the provided configuration field. 6. Save the updated settings and deploy. If you do not add a configuration for Knox Capture in Managed Google Play when updating a license key, the app operates according to its _previous_ configuration. For example, a device with an existing scan configuration will continue to operate in Managed mode after updating the license key. However, a new device without an existing configuration will operate in Admin mode. To ensure _all_ devices operate in Managed mode, prepare and include the configuration each time you add or modify the app within the EMM console. Sharing and importing configurations Once a configuration has been exported, it can be shared with other devices running the app in Admin mode

. Direct the camera at the QR code. 3. After scanning the QR code, Knox Capture automatically imports the configuration and displays a success message. If the configuration is too large for one QR code, Knox Capture displays multiple QR codes in a PDF file. The end user must scan them all to complete the import process. If the user attempts to scan a QR code that isn't part of the same configuration, an error message is shown on the overlay until a different one is scanned.

Knox Capture v1.5 release notes. Scanner overlay Starting with Knox Capture v1.5, a scanner overlay is available. This overlay appears as a scanner preview over business apps, and enables device users to immediately see scanned data entered into an app field. Functionally, the scanner overlay works much like the full-screen scanner. When the device user aims the camera at the barcode, Knox Capture then sends the scanned data to the business app depending on whether single scan or multi-scan mode is enabled, and how Barcode selection is configured. See Use the scanner overlay to learn more. Continuous scanning for single scan mode Previously, when device users scanned single barcodes, the camera preview turned on before each scan, then off again once the scan was completed. Now, in Single scan preferences, you can turn on Continuous scanning to scan back-to-back barcodes without relaunching the camera preview after every scan. This feature maximizes worker efficiency when used with a Bluetooth wedge or the scanner overlay. Improvements to configuration behavior after profile mode change With this release, if a Knox Capture profile is pushed to a device in Admin mode through a UEM, the device enters Managed mode and removes any configurations previously applied in Admin mode. For example, consider a device user who's conducting practice scans in Admin mode. Upon receiving a profile configuration, a notification on the device confirms that the configuration updated, and Knox Capture automatically turns off test mode and clears the test results. PDF417 barcode support for default profiles Starting with Knox Capture v1.5, default profiles now include the PDF417 barcode type. The current barcode symbologies enabled in the default profile are: Code 128, QR, Code 39, EAN8, EAN13/UPCA, UPCE, Interleaved 2 of 5, Data Matrix, PDF417 Back to release notes

. By default, the scan button appears in the bottom right corner of the device's screen. Users can move it around the screen, and it remains in the last known position until it's toggled off. The scan button can be used in both Admin and Managed modes. See Set camera trigger for more information on the various available triggers. License activation menu for unmanaged devices Previously, Knox Capture licenses could only be used by organizations pushing them through an MDM. Starting from Knox Capture v1.2, IT admins can now activate Knox Capture licenses in-app using the new license activation menu. To deactivate an entered license key, uninstall the Knox Capture app from your device. The license activation menu is only available in Admin mode. For more information, see Activate your license. Support for exporting large configurations through QR code !Multiple QR code export This Knox Capture version extends the QR code export functionality to support larger configurations. Prior to v1

Knox Capture v1.8 release notes. New features Knox Capture v1.8 introduces the following new features: #Continuous single scan A new Continuous scanning option appears on the Scan engine settings > Single scan preferences screen. When this option is toggled On, device users can scan several barcodes in sequence - and have each scan be registered as a single event - without having to press the camera trigger button between each scan. To learn more about the Continuous scanning feature, see Single scan preferences. #Scanner overlay In this release, device users have the option to view the camera preview window as an overlay on top of their business app. When the Scanner overlay feature is enabled and a scan is triggered, users will see a mini camera preview window on top of their existing business app screen. To learn more about this new feature, see Scanner overlay. #Inverse color barcode support This release adds a new Performance lab feature that allows users to scan inverse colored barcodes. This feature only works with Data Matrix and QR type barcodes in this release. To enable this option, go to the Knox Capture main screen, then tap the Options button (three dots), tap Performance lab, then enable Inverted color recognition. Enhancements Knox Capture v1.8 includes the following enhancements to existing features: #More intuitive user prompts when connecting USB device Previously, users would get a prompt even if Knox Capture wasn't running in the foreground. For example, a user might want to connect a USB keyboard for use in their business. When connecting the keyboard, they would see a prompt asking if they wanted to use the USB keyboard for scanning purposes, even though they may not be using Knox Capture at the time. This release improves the prompt so that it only shows when Knox Capture is being used in the foreground. The device user must grant system permissions for connected devices in order for the prompt to display. If no permissions are granted, the prompt will not display on any screen. #Seamlessly switch between multiple paired devices in Output path If a user is paired with multiple devices in Knox Capture's Output path, they can now switch between each of their paired devices more easily. Previously, if a user had two paired devices in Output path, and Knox Capture was connected to _device A_, the user would first have to disconnect from _device A_ before connecting to _device B_. With this release, the user simply has to connect to _device B_. Knox Capture automatically disconnects from any previously paired devices. #Receive a notification when overlay is restricted by IT admin Some device users may experience an issue where they are unable to view the camera preview window after triggering a scan. This issue can be caused by a restriction set by the IT admin and the organization's UEM policy. Previously, if the restriction was set, the user would simply not be able to see the preview window. In this release, the user will now get a notification asking them to contact their IT admin for more information. To learn more about the restriction, see the Knox Capture Knowledge Base Article (KBA) related to this issue. Back to release notes",307

Use scanner overlay. The Scanner overlay feature lets device users view the camera preview window and the business app screen concurrently. When the user triggers a barcode scan, a mini camera preview is shown over the business app screen as a picture-in-picture (PiP) window, allowing users to use the scanner and view their app's data at the same time. Functionally, the Scanner overlay behaves just like the normal scanner. When the device user aims the camera at the barcode, Knox Capture sends the scanned data to the business app depending on how the scan engine settings are configured. Enable the Scanner overlay The Scanner overlay can be enabled in both Admin and Managed modes. To enable this feature, go to the Knox Capture home screen, tap the Options button (three dots), tap Scanner overlay, then toggle the feature On. When you launch the scanner overlay for the first time, an on-screen tutorial explains how to reposition and resize the overlay. By default, the overlay appears at the top of the screen. Any size or position adjustments you make to it are saved for future scanning sessions. Tap the X in the top-right corner to close the Scanner overlay.

. 2. Scanner engine settings - specifying the barcode technologies (QR, Code 128, UPCA, etc.), scanning methods (single barcode, multi barcode), and camera behavior (enable flash, allow camera zoom). 3. Keystroke output rules - specifying how barcode data gets converted into keystrokes (append Tab or Enter character to each barcode, add prefix or suffix characters, convert output to hex characters, etc.) Default scanning profile Out-of-the-box, Knox Capture includes a default scanning profile that gets automatically associated with all apps on the device. In other words, when Knox Capture is launched, *any* app can trigger the camera scanner and receive barcode data in the form of keystrokes. This makes it easy to use Knox Capture for basic scanning purposes without any additional setup. When using the default scanning profile, IT admins can change the profile's scan engine settings and data processing rules, however they cannot change the default profile's apps and activities behavior

Scanning profiles. Knox Capture acts as a wedge by translating barcode data into keystrokes that can be sent to a business application. But how does Knox Capture know what barcode types to scan, how to interpret scanned data, and which business applications to pass the data to? For Knox Capture, the *Scanning profile* defines the app's core behavior. A Scanning Profile is a configuration file that gets created or modified by an IT admin using the Knox Capture application. The profile defines how Knox Capture performs a barcode scan, and primarily consists of the following parameters: 1. Apps and activities - define which applications that can launch the Knox Capture scanner. 2. Scanner engine settings - specifying the barcode technologies (QR, Code 128, UPCA, etc.), scanning methods (single barcode, multi barcode), and camera behavior (enable flash, allow camera zoom). 3. Keystroke output rules - specifying how barcode data gets converted into keystrokes (append Tab or Enter character to each barcode, add prefix or suffix characters, convert output to hex characters, etc.) Default scanning profile Out-of-the-box, Knox Capture includes a default scanning profile that gets automatically associated with all apps on the device. In other words, when Knox Capture is launched, *any* app can trigger the camera scanner and receive barcode data in the form of keystrokes. This makes it easy to use Knox Capture for basic scanning purposes without any additional setup. When using the default scanning profile, IT admins can change the profile's scan engine settings and data processing rules, however they cannot change the default profile's apps and activities behavior. For example, an IT admin can modify the default profile to append a Tab key at the end of each barcode, but they cannot change which apps can trigger the scanner. Custom scanning profiles While the default scanning profile allows Knox Capture to be used right away without any configuration, IT admins may want to use a custom profile to better suit their needs. With a custom profile, IT admins control which apps and activities can trigger a barcode scan. Any apps that you don't select in the custom profile will follow the default behavior in that the barcode scanner is active for all apps not specified in the custom profile. Creating custom scanning profiles Custom profiles can be created by modifying the default profile settings, or by creating entirely new profiles altogether. 1. Tap the + button near the top of the app UI to open the profile creation options. 2. Select Create profile to start a profile from scratch, or select Duplicate existing profile to copy the settings from an existing (custom or default) profile. Alternatively, you can create a custom profile by clicking Create profile without clicking the + button. 3. Provide a profile name, then tap Done. The new profile appears in the profiles area below Defult scanning profile.

What new feature in Knox Capture version 1.7 allows for displaying an augmented reality overlay when barcodes are scanned?,Knox Capture AR (Augmented Reality).," The Knox Capture version 1.7 release notes mention a new augmented reality (AR) feature called Knox Capture AR:

Knox Capture AR (Augmented Reality) Version 1.7 of Knox Capture introduces a new AR (augmented reality) feature that displays an overlay on the device screen whenever one or more barcodes are scanned. IT admins can create AR templates to customize the information that displays on the overlay, as well as the overlay behavior.",1,1,6,1.0,0.9991217255592346,1,0,4.711994171142578,".

AR overview. The Knox Capture AR (Augmented Reality) is a feature that allows users to view important, business-critical information on the device screen when peforming a barcode scan. Normally, whenever a user launches the scanner, aims their camera at one or more barcodes, and captures the barcode data, Knox Capture simply passes the barcode information back to the business-app for review for the user to review. There is no way for the user to interact with any of the information until it reaches the business-app. To some organizations, scanning several barcodes and reviewing the data only _after_ it reaches the business-app can be inefficient, especially if the information isn't what they were looking for in the first place. This could lead to re-scans and additional worker overhead in order to capture the proper data. When a user triggers a barcode scan using Knox Capture AR, the camera preview window gets augmented with a customizable overlay that allows the user to view, analyze, and interact with the barcode data in real-time. For example, a retail worker using AR to scan an item could view information like the product's model number, sale price, or remaining inventory count, all from within the camera preview window, without ever having to open their business app to review the data. About AR templates Just like how scanning profiles define core Knox Capture behavior like which apps can trigger a scan, which barcodes are accepted, and what happens to data after it gets captured, AR templates also define the characteristics and behaviors of the Knox Capture AR feature. #Search-and-find templates This AR template provides an overlay to help users locate and isolate a single barcode when several similar barcodes are in the camera preview window. For example, a retail worker may be asked to locate a single box from a large wall of boxes in a warehouse. Using Knox Capture AR, the worker can start by scanning a reference barcode of the item they're searching for. After the reference barcode is scanned, the worker simply needs to point their camera at the wall of boxes in the warehouse. Knox Capture AR then analyzes each barcode in view, looking for a match. When a match is found, the AR overlay highlights the barcode, and additional product information is provided to the worker for review. #View-and-update templates This AR template provides an overlay to allow users to view product information and make real-time updates to a product database whenever a barcode is scanned. For example, a retail worker may want to know if there is enough inventory of a certain item before making a large-quantity transaction. Using Knox Capture AR, the worker can scan one of the items to bring up additional product information in the AR overlay. The worker can then see how many items are available in stock, and (after making the sale) immediately update their product database with a new stock count in real-time. See also , Refer to the Configure Knox Capture AR guide for instructions on creating Search-and-find and View-and-update AR templates as an IT admin. Refer to the Use Knox Capture AR guide for instructions on how to use AR templates to scan barcodes as an IT admin or end-user.

Knox Capture v1.5 release notes. Scanner overlay Starting with Knox Capture v1.5, a scanner overlay is available. This overlay appears as a scanner preview over business apps, and enables device users to immediately see scanned data entered into an app field. Functionally, the scanner overlay works much like the full-screen scanner. When the device user aims the camera at the barcode, Knox Capture then sends the scanned data to the business app depending on whether single scan or multi-scan mode is enabled, and how Barcode selection is configured. See Use the scanner overlay to learn more. Continuous scanning for single scan mode Previously, when device users scanned single barcodes, the camera preview turned on before each scan, then off again once the scan was completed. Now, in Single scan preferences, you can turn on Continuous scanning to scan back-to-back barcodes without relaunching the camera preview after every scan

Configure AR. Refer to the following instructions for creating Knox Capture AR templates. Configure Search-and-find template To create an AR template that allows users to search for a reference barcode: 1.

Tap the menu buton (three vertical dots) next to the search icon on the Knox Capture home screen, then select Augmented reality > Configure AR. 2. On the template selection screen, tap View and update. 3. In AR overlay settings, give your template a name and provide your database server address in the Template URL field. This field is _mandatory_, and it allows Knox Capture AR to connect to your database in order to view and update product information during each barcode scan. See Connecting AR to a database server for more information. 4. In Barcode types, select the barcode technologies that you want Knox Capture AR to scan. 5. Tap Continue to save your template. You'll be taken to the AR overlay field selection screen. See Customize AR overlay information to learn more. Customize AR overlay information After you connect Knox Capture AR to a product database server, the AR overlay can display important product information on-screen whenever a barcode is scanned. This information is presented in a pop-up above the barcode, and contains the following: Title - This is the main text that appears in the pop-up whenever a barcode is scanned. Image - This image appears as a thumbnail in the pop-up, and as a larger image in the product details whenever the user taps the > button. Fields - This information appears in the the product details after the user taps the > button. To configure the AR overlay information: 1. On the AR templates screen, find the template that you want to customize and tap the menu button (three vertical dots), then tap Edit. 2. In Title, select the data that you want to display as the main title in the pop-up. 3. In Image, select how you want the image to appear - whether a thumbnail or full size image - when the user expands the Product details. Note that this step affects the image in the product details. The thumbnail image always appears in the pop-up, regardless of the size you select. 4. In Fields, select the information that appears when the user the > button to expand the product details in the pop-up. For View-and-update AR templates, admins can specify which fields can be updated by the user by tapping the edit icon (pencil) next to a field name. The edit icon turns blue to indicate fields that can be overwritten. Note that fields only display the edit icon if they were given WRITE permissions in the database. 5. Tap Done to save the settings. Connecting AR to a database server For customers who want to display important product details in the AR overlay every time a barcode is scanned, a connection between Knox Capture and the database server must first be set up

Knox Capture v1.5 release notes. Scanner overlay Starting with Knox Capture v1.5, a scanner overlay is available. This overlay appears as a scanner preview over business apps, and enables device users to immediately see scanned data entered into an app field. Functionally, the scanner overlay works much like the full-screen scanner. When the device user aims the camera at the barcode, Knox Capture then sends the scanned data to the business app depending on whether single scan or multi-scan mode is enabled, and how Barcode selection is configured. See Use the scanner overlay to learn more. Continuous scanning for single scan mode Previously, when device users scanned single barcodes, the camera preview turned on before each scan, then off again once the scan was completed. Now, in Single scan preferences, you can turn on Continuous scanning to scan back-to-back barcodes without relaunching the camera preview after every scan. This feature maximizes worker efficiency when used with a Bluetooth wedge or the scanner overlay. Improvements to configuration behavior after profile mode change With this release, if a Knox Capture profile is pushed to a device in Admin mode through a UEM, the device enters Managed mode and removes any configurations previously applied in Admin mode. For example, consider a device user who's conducting practice scans in Admin mode. Upon receiving a profile configuration, a notification on the device confirms that the configuration updated, and Knox Capture automatically turns off test mode and clears the test results. PDF417 barcode support for default profiles Starting with Knox Capture v1.5, default profiles now include the PDF417 barcode type. The current barcode symbologies enabled in the default profile are: Code 128, QR, Code 39, EAN8, EAN13/UPCA, UPCE, Interleaved 2 of 5, Data Matrix, PDF417 Back to release notes",440
What recommendations are made for customers using tiny Code 93 or Code 128 barcodes to improve barcode scan success rate with Knox Capture?,"It is recommended that customers avoid using tiny barcodes whenever possible to increase the success rate of scans. If tiny barcodes must be used, it is recommended that customers attempt to block or cover any glare on the barcodes before scanning.","
To improve the barcode scan success rate for tiny Code 93 or Code 128 barcodes with Knox Capture, the recommendations are:

1. Avoid using tiny barcodes whenver possible to increase the success rate of scans. The context notes that Knox Capture may have difficulties scanning barcodes that are too small for Code 93 and Code 128 specifically.

2. Attempt to block or cover any glare on the barcodes before scanning. The context notes that testers have reported Knox Capture can have difficulties detecting all barcodes under extreme glare conditions.",1,4,6,0.25,0.9998131394386292,1,0,6.748205900192261,".

Out-of-range barcode still scanned successfully by Knox Capture. Overview For example, assuming you've set a symbol count range of 7 - 20 for Code 128 barcodes, the following situations may occur: Code ""1234567"" (length 7) can be successfully scanned. Code ""12345678"" (length 8) can be successfully scanned. Code ""123456"" (length 6) can't be successfully scanned. Code ""12345"" (length 5) can be successfully scanned. This is unexpected behavior. Code ""1234"" (length 4) can't be successfully scanned. Cause When setting the scan length, there's a difference between the number of digits or characters and the active symbol count. The correlation between characters and symbol counts depends on the encoding standard. For instance, Code 128 differs from Code 39. For Code 128, there are three different encoding schemes that can be mixed within a single Code 128 barcode to achieve the shortest possible code. Resolution Check which encoding standards your barcode data follows.

Configure scan engine settings. Scan engine settings define the core Knox Capture behavior, such as how barcodes are scanned, and what happens with the data after each scan. The following settings are available: Barcode types Choose the barcode symbologies the scanner should recognize. For example, Code 39, and QR code. Available barcode types: Type , Options - , - Numeric-only (1D) , Codabar, EAN13, EAN8, Interleaved 2 of 5, UPCA, UPCE Alphanumeric (1D) , Code 128, Code 39, Code 93 2D , Data Matrix, PDF417, QR Every barcode except Codabar and Code 93 is enabled by default.

In the same way, Knox Capture acts as middleware that reads barcode data captured by the XCover Pro device, translates it into a string, formats the string, and then sends it to a third-party business app that understands the resulting data. Knox Capture takes care of integrating with your business app, so that you don't have to build barcode scanning logic into your business app using a software development kit (SDK). So how does Knox Capture know which barcodes to read, how to format the data, and which business app to send the data to? The IT admin defines those details in a profile in Knox Capture. Once the IT admin has configured the profile, they push it to enterprise devices through their EMM. Device users can then start using the business app to scan barcodes.

Overview. Get started with the basics by learning what Knox Capture is and how it works. What is Knox Capture? To help explain what Knox Capture does, it may be helpful to start with an understanding of what a *wedge* scanner is, and how it relates to the Knox Capture solution. In traditional hardware-based barcode scanning terminology, a wedge scanner is a physical device that attaches between a keyboard and a computer. The keyboard attaches to the scanner, and the scanner attaches to the computer. From the computer's perspective, the scanner behaves just like an additional keyboard. When the computer runs a software program (like an inventory spreadsheet app), and barcodes are read using the wedge scanner, data is sent from the scanner to the program in the form of keystrokes. From the program's point of view, data appears exactly as if someone had typed it manually using a keyboard. How Knox Capture works In a similar way, Knox Capture also acts as a wedge between a software program and keyboard. However, instead of being a physical scanning device, Knox Capture is a mobile solution built for compatible Android smartphones and tablets. Enterprise IT admins can either download the Knox Capture app from Google Play, or custom-build their own wedge scanner apps using the Knox Capture SDK (Software Development Kit). Once Knox Capture is installed and running on a device, it *wedges* between an application (for example, a business app used to track inventory) and the mobile device's on-screen keyboard. When an end-user launches their business app, they can simply tap an on-screen button or press a hardware button on their device to trigger a barcode scan using the device's camera. After the camera focuses on a barcode, Knox Capture translates the barcode data into keystrokes, which then get passed back to the business app for processing. From the business app's point of view, keystrokes coming from Knox Capture appear exactly as if a user had typed them from the device keyboard. Who can use Knox Capture? Knox Capture is designed for anyone who wants to turn their mobile device into a powerful barcode scanner. However, depending on whether it's being used by an admin or an end-user, its features vary significantly. #Admin mode (Default) When Knox Capture is downloaded from Google Play and installed on a compatible Android device - and a valid license key is activated - the app operates in its default Admin mode. This mode allows the device user - typically an enterprise IT admin - to utilize the full functionality of the app to primarily do the following: 1. Create scanning profiles that define which apps can launch the barcode scanner, which barcode types can be scanned (QR, Code 128, EAN8, etc.), and how scanned data is formatted (append Tab or Enter key, insert special characters before or after data, etc.). 2. Test scanning profiles to ensure that appropriate business apps can launch the scanner and receive data back as keystrokes. 3. Export profile settings as a configuration file, which can then be used by EMM/UEM administrators to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to end-user devices. #Managed mode After an IT admin uses their EMM/UEM to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to an end-user's device, the device launches the app in Managed mode. In Managed mode, Knox Capture functionality is greatly reduced. End-users can review their scanning profile settings and perform barcode scans using their business apps (as permitted by their scanning profile), however they can't make changes to their scanning profiles, export profile settings, or switch to Admin mode by activating a Knox Capture license. Admin mode is the default mode of operation for Knox Capture. The procedures described in this guide are targeted at an IT admin audience. Further reading #Getting started tutorials These tutorials provide a guided workflow for new admins and end-users. While they don't cover every setting or scenario when using Knox Capture, they do provide a good starting point for learning the app's basics

Keystroke output data sent to browser or web app instead of business app. Overview Certain company-owned devices with a work profile might encounter an issue where barcode data sent through keystroke output is delivered to a browser or web app instead of the business app. Cause With recent improvements to company-owned devices with a work profile, a change was made to the way web apps - apps delivered through the browser instead of natively on Android - handle text view focus after scanning. On devices running Android 10 and lower, the text view is already in focus when scanned data returns to the business app. This focus behavior is no longer required with company-owned devices with a work profile running Android 11 and higher. Resolution To handle this change, you must enable the Allow remote control policy in your EMM to allow Knox Capture to restore focus to the text view. You only need to enable this policy if you've activated a Knox Platform for Enterprise Premium license.

Overview. Get started with the basics by learning what Knox Capture is and how it works. What is Knox Capture? To help explain what Knox Capture does, it may be helpful to start with an understanding of what a *wedge* scanner is, and how it relates to the Knox Capture solution. In traditional hardware-based barcode scanning terminology, a wedge scanner is a physical device that attaches between a keyboard and a computer. The keyboard attaches to the scanner, and the scanner attaches to the computer. From the computer's perspective, the scanner behaves just like an additional keyboard. When the computer runs a software program (like an inventory spreadsheet app), and barcodes are read using the wedge scanner, data is sent from the scanner to the program in the form of keystrokes. From the program's point of view, data appears exactly as if someone had typed it manually using a keyboard. How Knox Capture works In a similar way, Knox Capture also acts as a wedge between a software program and keyboard. However, instead of being a physical scanning device, Knox Capture is a mobile solution built for compatible Android smartphones and tablets. Enterprise IT admins can either download the Knox Capture app from Google Play, or custom-build their own wedge scanner apps using the Knox Capture SDK (Software Development Kit). Once Knox Capture is installed and running on a device, it *wedges* between an application (for example, a business app used to track inventory) and the mobile device's on-screen keyboard. When an end-user launches their business app, they can simply tap an on-screen button or press a hardware button on their device to trigger a barcode scan using the device's camera. After the camera focuses on a barcode, Knox Capture translates the barcode data into keystrokes, which then get passed back to the business app for processing. From the business app's point of view, keystrokes coming from Knox Capture appear exactly as if a user had typed them from the device keyboard. Who can use Knox Capture? Knox Capture is designed for anyone who wants to turn their mobile device into a powerful barcode scanner. However, depending on whether it's being used by an admin or an end-user, its features vary significantly. #Admin mode (Default) When Knox Capture is downloaded from Google Play and installed on a compatible Android device - and a valid license key is activated - the app operates in its default Admin mode. This mode allows the device user - typically an enterprise IT admin - to utilize the full functionality of the app to primarily do the following: 1. Create scanning profiles that define which apps can launch the barcode scanner, which barcode types can be scanned (QR, Code 128, EAN8, etc.), and how scanned data is formatted (append Tab or Enter key, insert special characters before or after data, etc.). 2. Test scanning profiles to ensure that appropriate business apps can launch the scanner and receive data back as keystrokes. 3. Export profile settings as a configuration file, which can then be used by EMM/UEM administrators to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to end-user devices. #Managed mode After an IT admin uses their EMM/UEM to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to an end-user's device, the device launches the app in Managed mode. In Managed mode, Knox Capture functionality is greatly reduced. End-users can review their scanning profile settings and perform barcode scans using their business apps (as permitted by their scanning profile), however they can't make changes to their scanning profiles, export profile settings, or switch to Admin mode by activating a Knox Capture license. Admin mode is the default mode of operation for Knox Capture. The procedures described in this guide are targeted at an IT admin audience. Further reading #Getting started tutorials These tutorials provide a guided workflow for new admins and end-users. While they don't cover every setting or scenario when using Knox Capture, they do provide a good starting point for learning the app's basics",552

Uninstalling the Knox Capture app automatically deactivates the license. If you install Knox Capture again, you must re-enter the license key in the License menu. View remaining scans From Knox Capture v1.6 onwards, if you are using the free version of Knox Capture, you can now view the number of remaining scans directly on the License page. When 10 or fewer scans remain, the camera preview window notifies the user that the remaining scan count is low. Deactivate a license If a device is inactive for 180 days, its Knox Capture license assignment is automatically released. If Knox Capture records activity on the device after 180 days have elapsed, the server automatically handles reactivation. Knox Capture offers the following ways to deactivate your license: Using the Device Deactivation tool, Through your EMM, By uninstalling the Knox Capture app Performing a factory reset on a device does not automatically deactivate its Knox Capture license. #Using the Device Deactivation tool Like Knox Platform for Enterprise and Knox Suite license keys, Knox Capture license keys can be deactivated using the Device Deactivation tool in the Knox Admin Portal. Note that you need a list of device IMEIs to either deactivate or keep. For steps on how to access and use the Device Deactivation tool, see How to disassociate a device from a Knox license key. #Through your EMM If you activated your license through app configuration in your EMM, you can use one of the following methods to deactivate your license: Push an uninstallation command for the Knox Capture app. Once the device receives the command, the Knox Capture app is removed and its license seat is unassigned. Edit the license field in the Knox Capture app configuration. On the app configuration screen in your EMM, replace the existing license key string with DEACTIVATE and save your changes. Once the Knox Capture agent detects the new string, the license is deactivated. Before editing the license field, verify whether you are targeting the correct devices in your EMM. Failure to do so may cause all your devices to be unenrolled from Knox Capture. Unenroll the device from your EMM. Doing so forces an app uninstallation and releases the device's license seat

Manage licenses. Customers who download Knox Capture from Google Play and use it for the first time are automatically given a trial license that allows them to try the app and perform up to 100 free scans. After the free scan limit has been reached, a valid Knox Suite license is required for continued use. Get a Knox Suite license The first step towards getting a Knox Suite license is signing up for a Samsung Knox account if you haven't already done so.

You must enable the Allow remote control policy in your EMM to allow Knox Capture to restore focus to the text view. This policy allows Knox Capture to handle the change where web apps no longer require text view focus after scanning on Android 11 and higher. You only need to enable this policy if you've activated a Knox Platform for Enterprise Premium license.",1,1,4,1.0,0.9995898604393005,1,0,10.338131427764893,"Keystroke output data sent to browser or web app instead of business app. Overview Certain company-owned devices with a work profile might encounter an issue where barcode data sent through keystroke output is delivered to a browser or web app instead of the business app. Cause With recent improvements to company-owned devices with a work profile, a change was made to the way web apps - apps delivered through the browser instead of natively on Android - handle text view focus after scanning. On devices running Android 10 and lower, the text view is already in focus when scanned data returns to the business app. This focus behavior is no longer required with company-owned devices with a work profile running Android 11 and higher. Resolution To handle this change, you must enable the Allow remote control policy in your EMM to allow Knox Capture to restore focus to the text view. You only need to enable this policy if you've activated a Knox Platform for Enterprise Premium license.

AR overview. The Knox Capture AR (Augmented Reality) is a feature that allows users to view important, business-critical information on the device screen when peforming a barcode scan. Normally, whenever a user launches the scanner, aims their camera at one or more barcodes, and captures the barcode data, Knox Capture simply passes the barcode information back to the business-app for review for the user to review. There is no way for the user to interact with any of the information until it reaches the business-app. To some organizations, scanning several barcodes and reviewing the data only _after_ it reaches the business-app can be inefficient, especially if the information isn't what they were looking for in the first place. This could lead to re-scans and additional worker overhead in order to capture the proper data. When a user triggers a barcode scan using Knox Capture AR, the camera preview window gets augmented with a customizable overlay that allows the user to view, analyze, and interact with the barcode data in real-time. For example, a retail worker using AR to scan an item could view information like the product's model number, sale price, or remaining inventory count, all from within the camera preview window, without ever having to open their business app to review the data. About AR templates Just like how scanning profiles define core Knox Capture behavior like which apps can trigger a scan, which barcodes are accepted, and what happens to data after it gets captured, AR templates also define the characteristics and behaviors of the Knox Capture AR feature. #Search-and-find templates This AR template provides an overlay to help users locate and isolate a single barcode when several similar barcodes are in the camera preview window. For example, a retail worker may be asked to locate a single box from a large wall of boxes in a warehouse. Using Knox Capture AR, the worker can start by scanning a reference barcode of the item they're searching for. After the reference barcode is scanned, the worker simply needs to point their camera at the wall of boxes in the warehouse. Knox Capture AR then analyzes each barcode in view, looking for a match. When a match is found, the AR overlay highlights the barcode, and additional product information is provided to the worker for review. #View-and-update templates This AR template provides an overlay to allow users to view product information and make real-time updates to a product database whenever a barcode is scanned. For example, a retail worker may want to know if there is enough inventory of a certain item before making a large-quantity transaction. Using Knox Capture AR, the worker can scan one of the items to bring up additional product information in the AR overlay. The worker can then see how many items are available in stock, and (after making the sale) immediately update their product database with a new stock count in real-time. See also , Refer to the Configure Knox Capture AR guide for instructions on creating Search-and-find and View-and-update AR templates as an IT admin. Refer to the Use Knox Capture AR guide for instructions on how to use AR templates to scan barcodes as an IT admin or end-user.

Overview. Get started with the basics by learning what Knox Capture is and how it works. What is Knox Capture? To help explain what Knox Capture does, it may be helpful to start with an understanding of what a *wedge* scanner is, and how it relates to the Knox Capture solution. In traditional hardware-based barcode scanning terminology, a wedge scanner is a physical device that attaches between a keyboard and a computer. The keyboard attaches to the scanner, and the scanner attaches to the computer. From the computer's perspective, the scanner behaves just like an additional keyboard. When the computer runs a software program (like an inventory spreadsheet app), and barcodes are read using the wedge scanner, data is sent from the scanner to the program in the form of keystrokes. From the program's point of view, data appears exactly as if someone had typed it manually using a keyboard. How Knox Capture works In a similar way, Knox Capture also acts as a wedge between a software program and keyboard. However, instead of being a physical scanning device, Knox Capture is a mobile solution built for compatible Android smartphones and tablets. Enterprise IT admins can either download the Knox Capture app from Google Play, or custom-build their own wedge scanner apps using the Knox Capture SDK (Software Development Kit). Once Knox Capture is installed and running on a device, it *wedges* between an application (for example, a business app used to track inventory) and the mobile device's on-screen keyboard. When an end-user launches their business app, they can simply tap an on-screen button or press a hardware button on their device to trigger a barcode scan using the device's camera. After the camera focuses on a barcode, Knox Capture translates the barcode data into keystrokes, which then get passed back to the business app for processing. From the business app's point of view, keystrokes coming from Knox Capture appear exactly as if a user had typed them from the device keyboard. Who can use Knox Capture? Knox Capture is designed for anyone who wants to turn their mobile device into a powerful barcode scanner. However, depending on whether it's being used by an admin or an end-user, its features vary significantly. #Admin mode (Default) When Knox Capture is downloaded from Google Play and installed on a compatible Android device - and a valid license key is activated - the app operates in its default Admin mode. This mode allows the device user - typically an enterprise IT admin - to utilize the full functionality of the app to primarily do the following: 1. Create scanning profiles that define which apps can launch the barcode scanner, which barcode types can be scanned (QR, Code 128, EAN8, etc.), and how scanned data is formatted (append Tab or Enter key, insert special characters before or after data, etc.). 2. Test scanning profiles to ensure that appropriate business apps can launch the scanner and receive data back as keystrokes. 3. Export profile settings as a configuration file, which can then be used by EMM/UEM administrators to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to end-user devices. #Managed mode After an IT admin uses their EMM/UEM to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to an end-user's device, the device launches the app in Managed mode. In Managed mode, Knox Capture functionality is greatly reduced. End-users can review their scanning profile settings and perform barcode scans using their business apps (as permitted by their scanning profile), however they can't make changes to their scanning profiles, export profile settings, or switch to Admin mode by activating a Knox Capture license. Admin mode is the default mode of operation for Knox Capture. The procedures described in this guide are targeted at an IT admin audience. Further reading #Getting started tutorials These tutorials provide a guided workflow for new admins and end-users. While they don't cover every setting or scenario when using Knox Capture, they do provide a good starting point for learning the app's basics",434

How Knox Capture works In a similar way, Knox Capture also acts as a wedge between a software program and keyboard

Why is Knox Capture called a wedge? . A wedge barcode scanner is a physical device that attaches to a keyboard or a computer. It reads barcode data and translates it to a string that is then input into the system, as if a user had manually typed the string using the keyboard. In the same way, Knox Capture acts as middleware that reads barcode data captured by the XCover Pro device, translates it into a string, formats the string, and then sends it to a third-party business app that understands the resulting data. Knox Capture takes care of integrating with your business app, so that you don't have to build barcode scanning logic into your business app using a software development kit (SDK). So how does Knox Capture know which barcodes to read, how to format the data, and which business app to send the data to? The IT admin defines those details in a profile in Knox Capture.

When an end-user launches their business app, they can simply tap an on-screen button or press a hardware button on their device to trigger a barcode scan using the device's camera. After the camera focuses on a barcode, Knox Capture translates the barcode data into keystrokes, which then get passed back to the business app for processing. From the business app's point of view, keystrokes coming from Knox Capture appear exactly as if a user had typed them from the device keyboard. Who can use Knox Capture? Knox Capture is designed for anyone who wants to turn their mobile device into a powerful barcode scanner. However, depending on whether it's being used by an admin or an end-user, its features vary significantly. #Admin mode (Default) When Knox Capture is downloaded from Google Play and installed on a compatible Android device - and a valid license key is activated - the app operates in its default Admin mode. This mode allows the device user - typically an enterprise IT admin - to utilize the full functionality of the app to primarily do the following: 1. Create scanning profiles that define which apps can launch the barcode scanner, which barcode types can be scanned (QR, Code 128, EAN8, etc.), and how scanned data is formatted (append Tab or Enter key, insert special characters before or after data, etc.). 2. Test scanning profiles to ensure that appropriate business apps can launch the scanner and receive data back as keystrokes. 3. Export profile settings as a configuration file, which can then be used by EMM/UEM administrators to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to end-user devices. #Managed mode After an IT admin uses their EMM/UEM to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to an end-user's device, the device launches the app in Managed mode. In Managed mode, Knox Capture functionality is greatly reduced. End-users can review their scanning profile settings and perform barcode scans using their business apps (as permitted by their scanning profile), however they can't make changes to their scanning profiles, export profile settings, or switch to Admin mode by activating a Knox Capture license. Admin mode is the default mode of operation for Knox Capture. The procedures described in this guide are targeted at an IT admin audience. Further reading #Getting started tutorials These tutorials provide a guided workflow for new admins and end-users. While they don't cover every setting or scenario when using Knox Capture, they do provide a good starting point for learning the app's basics

Configure output path. Knox Capture can send scanned data to a Bluetooth-enabled device, like a PC, as a Human Interface Device (HID) keyboard, emulating the functionality of a hardware scanner. This feature is ideal for high-security enterprises with wireless network restrictions. For example, you might want to keep track of which assets are checked in or out of a restricted facility. In that case, you can use Knox Capture to scan an asset tag and send its data directly to a PC through Bluetooth. How it works The following describes how connected devices and scanned data are handled when using Knox Capture's Bluetooth wedge functionality: If the device is connected to a PC, output data is entered at the location of the keyboard cursor. Knox Capture applies any basic and advanced data formatting rules set in the default scanning profile to the output data. Only one Bluetooth-enabled device can be connected at a time. To connect to another device, you must first disconnect the current one",369

Scanning profiles. Knox Capture acts as a wedge by translating barcode data into keystrokes that can be sent to a business application. But how does Knox Capture know what barcode types to scan, how to interpret scanned data, and which business applications to pass the data to? For Knox Capture, the *Scanning profile* defines the app's core behavior. A Scanning Profile is a configuration file that gets created or modified by an IT admin using the Knox Capture application. The profile defines how Knox Capture performs a barcode scan, and primarily consists of the following parameters: 1. Apps and activities - define which applications that can launch the Knox Capture scanner. 2. Scanner engine settings - specifying the barcode technologies (QR, Code 128, UPCA, etc.), scanning methods (single barcode, multi barcode), and camera behavior (enable flash, allow camera zoom). 3. Keystroke output rules - specifying how barcode data gets converted into keystrokes (append Tab or Enter character to each barcode, add prefix or suffix characters, convert output to hex characters, etc.) Default scanning profile Out-of-the-box, Knox Capture includes a default scanning profile that gets automatically associated with all apps on the device. In other words, when Knox Capture is launched, *any* app can trigger the camera scanner and receive barcode data in the form of keystrokes. This makes it easy to use Knox Capture for basic scanning purposes without any additional setup. When using the default scanning profile, IT admins can change the profile's scan engine settings and data processing rules, however they cannot change the default profile's apps and activities behavior. For example, an IT admin can modify the default profile to append a Tab key at the end of each barcode, but they cannot change which apps can trigger the scanner. Custom scanning profiles While the default scanning profile allows Knox Capture to be used right away without any configuration, IT admins may want to use a custom profile to better suit their needs. With a custom profile, IT admins control which apps and activities can trigger a barcode scan. Any apps that you don't select in the custom profile will follow the default behavior in that the barcode scanner is active for all apps not specified in the custom profile. Creating custom scanning profiles Custom profiles can be created by modifying the default profile settings, or by creating entirely new profiles altogether. 1. Tap the + button near the top of the app UI to open the profile creation options. 2. Select Create profile to start a profile from scratch, or select Duplicate existing profile to copy the settings from an existing (custom or default) profile. Alternatively, you can create a custom profile by clicking Create profile without clicking the + button. 3. Provide a profile name, then tap Done. The new profile appears in the profiles area below Defult scanning profile.

Add all activities at once To add apps as a single activity: 1. Tap the radio button to the left of the app name within the Select applications list. 2. An app can also be selected by tapping its name, then tapping the All button at the upper-left of the app activities list. Add individual activities visually To add individual apps visually: 1. Within the app activities list page, tap the wand icon in the upper-right corner to launch the visual selection tool. 2. If this is the first time using the visual selection tool, a series of pop-up messages display with information on selecting activities. Tap anywhere on the screen to advance the pop-ups. If the visual selection tool has been previously invoked, the pop-up messages do not display. 3. Navigate within the app to locate an activity. A blue selector overlay (pictured above) displays on each screen to name the activity associated with that screen. Drag this selector around the screen as needed to view the app user interface. 4. To select an activity, tap the radio button next to the activity name within the blue overlay. As activities are added, the counter in the overlay, next to the DONE button, increments with each selection. 5. When completed adding activities, tap DONE to navigate back to the app activities list page. Add individual activities from the activities list 1. Locate an activity to add within the app activities list page. If you know the name of the activity, tap the magnifying glass located on the upper-right of the screen to enter a search term. 2. Tap the radio button to the left of each activity you would like to add.

. If the user navigates to a different business app to initiate a scan instead, the original scan data is discarded. New indicators for tested app activities When testing configurations in Admin mode, IT admins can now view a list of created app activities under the profile. Any activity not visible in the list behaves under the default profile. After being tested, each activity displays a green checkmark to its right to indicate its tested status. Refer to Check a configuration in test mode to learn more. Hardware scanner support Knox Capture v1.2 adds support for USB and Bluetooth hardware scanners. After the scanner is paired or connected, IT admins and end users can switch between their device's camera and the scanner for seamless data capture and delivery to business apps. Currently, v1.2 supports all HW scanners with HID connection

Configure apps and activities. Each Knox Capture profile supports a set of apps to which its scanner and keystroke output settings apply. IT admins can set more refined control over each scanning context within an app by associating individual Android activities with different Knox Capture profiles. A user interacts with an Android activity within an app's UI, such as a user data form or search input. Refer to the Android developer documentation for more information about activities. Depending on deployment requirements, consider configuring one profile for all apps. Or, set up a unique profile for each device app. Or, associate a group of apps or activities with one profile. For example, within the *same* app, consider associating: A user data form with one profile that appends a Tab key event to scanned data, A search input field with a profile that appends an Enter key event A single profile can have numerous apps or activities, but a single activity can only belong to one profile

. Scanned data - The scanned barcode data in test mode notation without any keystroke output rules applied. Scanned raw - The scanned barcode data in hexadecimal format without any keystroke output rules applied. 4. Expand the overlay by tapping its down arrow icon for a full view of the test data. 5. Inspect and compare the Scanned data to the Output value to verify the correct keystroke output rules and scanning settings for the activity in question. 6. Repeat for each app included in the configuration as required. After testing an app, there should be a green check mark badge next to the app logo on the Test apps screen. Use this to track testing progress. 7. Tap All activities under an app to open a list of app activities that are included in the profile you're testing. Here, you can check if individual activities were tested. If so, a green checkmark appears next to the activity. 8

Scanning profiles. Knox Capture acts as a wedge by translating barcode data into keystrokes that can be sent to a business application. But how does Knox Capture know what barcode types to scan, how to interpret scanned data, and which business applications to pass the data to? For Knox Capture, the *Scanning profile* defines the app's core behavior. A Scanning Profile is a configuration file that gets created or modified by an IT admin using the Knox Capture application. The profile defines how Knox Capture performs a barcode scan, and primarily consists of the following parameters: 1. Apps and activities - define which applications that can launch the Knox Capture scanner. 2. Scanner engine settings - specifying the barcode technologies (QR, Code 128, UPCA, etc.), scanning methods (single barcode, multi barcode), and camera behavior (enable flash, allow camera zoom). 3. Keystroke output rules - specifying how barcode data gets converted into keystrokes (append Tab or Enter character to each barcode, add prefix or suffix characters, convert output to hex characters, etc.) Default scanning profile Out-of-the-box, Knox Capture includes a default scanning profile that gets automatically associated with all apps on the device. In other words, when Knox Capture is launched, *any* app can trigger the camera scanner and receive barcode data in the form of keystrokes. This makes it easy to use Knox Capture for basic scanning purposes without any additional setup. When using the default scanning profile, IT admins can change the profile's scan engine settings and data processing rules, however they cannot change the default profile's apps and activities behavior. For example, an IT admin can modify the default profile to append a Tab key at the end of each barcode, but they cannot change which apps can trigger the scanner. Custom scanning profiles While the default scanning profile allows Knox Capture to be used right away without any configuration, IT admins may want to use a custom profile to better suit their needs. With a custom profile, IT admins control which apps and activities can trigger a barcode scan. Any apps that you don't select in the custom profile will follow the default behavior in that the barcode scanner is active for all apps not specified in the custom profile. Creating custom scanning profiles Custom profiles can be created by modifying the default profile settings, or by creating entirely new profiles altogether. 1. Tap the + button near the top of the app UI to open the profile creation options. 2. Select Create profile to start a profile from scratch, or select Duplicate existing profile to copy the settings from an existing (custom or default) profile. Alternatively, you can create a custom profile by clicking Create profile without clicking the + button. 3. Provide a profile name, then tap Done. The new profile appears in the profiles area below Defult scanning profile.",260

. When connecting the keyboard, they would see a prompt asking if they wanted to use the USB keyboard for scanning purposes, even though they may not be using Knox Capture at the time. This release improves the prompt so that it only shows when Knox Capture is being used in the foreground. The device user must grant system permissions for connected devices in order for the prompt to display. If no permissions are granted, the prompt will not display on any screen. #Seamlessly switch between multiple paired devices in Output path If a user is paired with multiple devices in Knox Capture's Output path, they can now switch between each of their paired devices more easily. Previously, if a user had two paired devices in Output path, and Knox Capture was connected to _device A_, the user would first have to disconnect from _device A_ before connecting to _device B_. With this release, the user simply has to connect to _device B_. Knox Capture automatically disconnects from any previously paired devices",456

Overview. Get started with the basics by learning what Knox Capture is and how it works. What is Knox Capture? To help explain what Knox Capture does, it may be helpful to start with an understanding of what a *wedge* scanner is, and how it relates to the Knox Capture solution. In traditional hardware-based barcode scanning terminology, a wedge scanner is a physical device that attaches between a keyboard and a computer. The keyboard attaches to the scanner, and the scanner attaches to the computer. From the computer's perspective, the scanner behaves just like an additional keyboard. When the computer runs a software program (like an inventory spreadsheet app), and barcodes are read using the wedge scanner, data is sent from the scanner to the program in the form of keystrokes. From the program's point of view, data appears exactly as if someone had typed it manually using a keyboard. How Knox Capture works In a similar way, Knox Capture also acts as a wedge between a software program and keyboard. However, instead of being a physical scanning device, Knox Capture is a mobile solution built for compatible Android smartphones and tablets. Enterprise IT admins can either download the Knox Capture app from Google Play, or custom-build their own wedge scanner apps using the Knox Capture SDK (Software Development Kit). Once Knox Capture is installed and running on a device, it *wedges* between an application (for example, a business app used to track inventory) and the mobile device's on-screen keyboard. When an end-user launches their business app, they can simply tap an on-screen button or press a hardware button on their device to trigger a barcode scan using the device's camera. After the camera focuses on a barcode, Knox Capture translates the barcode data into keystrokes, which then get passed back to the business app for processing. From the business app's point of view, keystrokes coming from Knox Capture appear exactly as if a user had typed them from the device keyboard. Who can use Knox Capture? Knox Capture is designed for anyone who wants to turn their mobile device into a powerful barcode scanner. However, depending on whether it's being used by an admin or an end-user, its features vary significantly. #Admin mode (Default) When Knox Capture is downloaded from Google Play and installed on a compatible Android device - and a valid license key is activated - the app operates in its default Admin mode. This mode allows the device user - typically an enterprise IT admin - to utilize the full functionality of the app to primarily do the following: 1. Create scanning profiles that define which apps can launch the barcode scanner, which barcode types can be scanned (QR, Code 128, EAN8, etc.), and how scanned data is formatted (append Tab or Enter key, insert special characters before or after data, etc.). 2. Test scanning profiles to ensure that appropriate business apps can launch the scanner and receive data back as keystrokes. 3. Export profile settings as a configuration file, which can then be used by EMM/UEM administrators to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to end-user devices. #Managed mode After an IT admin uses their EMM/UEM to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to an end-user's device, the device launches the app in Managed mode. In Managed mode, Knox Capture functionality is greatly reduced. End-users can review their scanning profile settings and perform barcode scans using their business apps (as permitted by their scanning profile), however they can't make changes to their scanning profiles, export profile settings, or switch to Admin mode by activating a Knox Capture license. Admin mode is the default mode of operation for Knox Capture. The procedures described in this guide are targeted at an IT admin audience. Further reading #Getting started tutorials These tutorials provide a guided workflow for new admins and end-users. While they don't cover every setting or scenario when using Knox Capture, they do provide a good starting point for learning the app's basics",201

What are the two modes available in Knox Capture AR?,The two modes available in Knox Capture AR are 'Search' and 'View-and-Update'.," I have found two modes available in Knox Capture AR:

1. Search-and-find template: This AR template provides an overlay to help users locate and isolate a single barcode when several similar barcodes are in the camera preview window. For example, a retail worker may be asked to locate a single box from a large wall of boxes in a warehouse. 

2. View-and-update template: This AR template provides an overlay to allow users to view product information and make real-time updates to a product database whenever a barcode is scanned. For example, a retail worker may want to know if there is enough inventory of a certain item before making a large-quantity transaction.

So in summary, the two modes available in Knox Capture AR are Search-and-find templates and View-and-update templates.",0,0,6,0.0,0.9998220801353455,0,0,9.359773397445679,"AR overview. The Knox Capture AR (Augmented Reality) is a feature that allows users to view important, business-critical information on the device screen when peforming a barcode scan. Normally, whenever a user launches the scanner, aims their camera at one or more barcodes, and captures the barcode data, Knox Capture simply passes the barcode information back to the business-app for review for the user to review. There is no way for the user to interact with any of the information until it reaches the business-app. To some organizations, scanning several barcodes and reviewing the data only _after_ it reaches the business-app can be inefficient, especially if the information isn't what they were looking for in the first place. This could lead to re-scans and additional worker overhead in order to capture the proper data. When a user triggers a barcode scan using Knox Capture AR, the camera preview window gets augmented with a customizable overlay that allows the user to view, analyze, and interact with the barcode data in real-time. For example, a retail worker using AR to scan an item could view information like the product's model number, sale price, or remaining inventory count, all from within the camera preview window, without ever having to open their business app to review the data. About AR templates Just like how scanning profiles define core Knox Capture behavior like which apps can trigger a scan, which barcodes are accepted, and what happens to data after it gets captured, AR templates also define the characteristics and behaviors of the Knox Capture AR feature. #Search-and-find templates This AR template provides an overlay to help users locate and isolate a single barcode when several similar barcodes are in the camera preview window. For example, a retail worker may be asked to locate a single box from a large wall of boxes in a warehouse. Using Knox Capture AR, the worker can start by scanning a reference barcode of the item they're searching for. After the reference barcode is scanned, the worker simply needs to point their camera at the wall of boxes in the warehouse. Knox Capture AR then analyzes each barcode in view, looking for a match. When a match is found, the AR overlay highlights the barcode, and additional product information is provided to the worker for review. #View-and-update templates This AR template provides an overlay to allow users to view product information and make real-time updates to a product database whenever a barcode is scanned. For example, a retail worker may want to know if there is enough inventory of a certain item before making a large-quantity transaction. Using Knox Capture AR, the worker can scan one of the items to bring up additional product information in the AR overlay. The worker can then see how many items are available in stock, and (after making the sale) immediately update their product database with a new stock count in real-time. See also , Refer to the Configure Knox Capture AR guide for instructions on creating Search-and-find and View-and-update AR templates as an IT admin. Refer to the Use Knox Capture AR guide for instructions on how to use AR templates to scan barcodes as an IT admin or end-user.

Improvements to configuration behavior after profile mode change With this release, if a Knox Capture profile is pushed to a device in Admin mode through a UEM, the device enters Managed mode and removes any configurations previously applied in Admin mode. For example, consider a device user who's conducting practice scans in Admin mode. Upon receiving a profile configuration, a notification on the device confirms that the configuration updated, and Knox Capture automatically turns off test mode and clears the test results. PDF417 barcode support for default profiles Starting with Knox Capture v1.5, default profiles now include the PDF417 barcode type",273
How can an administrator configure the default profile setting so that it does not override application-specific configurations created for Knox Capture?,"To change the default profile setting, an administrator must go to Knox Capture’s main page and set the default profile to “Off.” This configuration cannot be changed in Managed mode."," There are a few relevant sentences:

. If you create profiles for several applications and don't want the default profile's behavior to override any configurations, set the default profile to Off. The default profile setting is available on the Knox Capture main page. You can change the configuration at any time, export and deploy it to end users in Managed mode.

So to prevent the default profile from overriding application-specific configurations in Knox Capture, an administrator can go to the Knox Capture main page and set the default profile to Off. This will allow the custom application profiles to take precedence.",1,1,6,1.0,0.9980935454368591,0,0,4.754051923751831,".

If a profile is not active for an app or foreground activity and the end user attempts to scan a barcode, an error message is shown stating that the application does not support Knox Capture scanning. This setting cannot be changed in Managed mode. New floating button scan trigger !Hardware scan trigger setting !Hardware scan trigger setting A floating scan button is now available that launches the Knox Capture camera for scanning.

Scanning profiles. Knox Capture acts as a wedge by translating barcode data into keystrokes that can be sent to a business application. But how does Knox Capture know what barcode types to scan, how to interpret scanned data, and which business applications to pass the data to? For Knox Capture, the *Scanning profile* defines the app's core behavior. A Scanning Profile is a configuration file that gets created or modified by an IT admin using the Knox Capture application. The profile defines how Knox Capture performs a barcode scan, and primarily consists of the following parameters: 1. Apps and activities - define which applications that can launch the Knox Capture scanner. 2. Scanner engine settings - specifying the barcode technologies (QR, Code 128, UPCA, etc.), scanning methods (single barcode, multi barcode), and camera behavior (enable flash, allow camera zoom). 3. Keystroke output rules - specifying how barcode data gets converted into keystrokes (append Tab or Enter character to each barcode, add prefix or suffix characters, convert output to hex characters, etc.) Default scanning profile Out-of-the-box, Knox Capture includes a default scanning profile that gets automatically associated with all apps on the device. In other words, when Knox Capture is launched, *any* app can trigger the camera scanner and receive barcode data in the form of keystrokes. This makes it easy to use Knox Capture for basic scanning purposes without any additional setup. When using the default scanning profile, IT admins can change the profile's scan engine settings and data processing rules, however they cannot change the default profile's apps and activities behavior. For example, an IT admin can modify the default profile to append a Tab key at the end of each barcode, but they cannot change which apps can trigger the scanner. Custom scanning profiles While the default scanning profile allows Knox Capture to be used right away without any configuration, IT admins may want to use a custom profile to better suit their needs. With a custom profile, IT admins control which apps and activities can trigger a barcode scan. Any apps that you don't select in the custom profile will follow the default behavior in that the barcode scanner is active for all apps not specified in the custom profile. Creating custom scanning profiles Custom profiles can be created by modifying the default profile settings, or by creating entirely new profiles altogether. 1. Tap the + button near the top of the app UI to open the profile creation options. 2. Select Create profile to start a profile from scratch, or select Duplicate existing profile to copy the settings from an existing (custom or default) profile. Alternatively, you can create a custom profile by clicking Create profile without clicking the + button. 3. Provide a profile name, then tap Done. The new profile appears in the profiles area below Defult scanning profile.

. When using the default scanning profile, IT admins can change the profile's scan engine settings and data processing rules, however they cannot change the default profile's apps and activities behavior. For example, an IT admin can modify the default profile to append a Tab key at the end of each barcode, but they cannot change which apps can trigger the scanner. Custom scanning profiles While the default scanning profile allows Knox Capture to be used right away without any configuration, IT admins may want to use a custom profile to better suit their needs. With a custom profile, IT admins control which apps and activities can trigger a barcode scan.

. 3. Export profile settings as a configuration file, which can then be used by EMM/UEM administrators to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to end-user devices. #Managed mode After an IT admin uses their EMM/UEM to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to an end-user's device, the device launches the app in Managed mode. In Managed mode, Knox Capture functionality is greatly reduced. End-users can review their scanning profile settings and perform barcode scans using their business apps (as permitted by their scanning profile), however they can't make changes to their scanning profiles, export profile settings, or switch to Admin mode by activating a Knox Capture license. Admin mode is the default mode of operation for Knox Capture. The procedures described in this guide are targeted at an IT admin audience.

Export and deploy configuration. Knox Capture uses a simple EMM-based deployment model. You first need to export a scanning configuration as a .txt file, then use an EMM add the file to your app configuration to deploy Knox Capture as a managed-app to your end-users. Exporting a configuration Exporting and sharing a scan configuration enables other devices apply the configuration to their installation. #Export options An IT admin can use several methods to export the configuration: Save it as a file on the device. Email it as a file attachment. Use Nearby share to send to another IT admin's device, Generate a QR code that can be scanned by other IT admins. To share a configuration on a per-device basis, transfer the configuration using near-field communication (NFC) or with a QR code. #Launch the export menu Regardless of the export method selected, begin by tapping the Share button in the lower-right of the home page to launch the Share configuration menu. #Save as file To save the file: 1

Knox Capture v1.2 release notes. This Knox Capture v1.2 release, scheduled to go live on July 30, 2021, includes several new features and improvements to existing functionality. Starting with Knox Capture v1.2, devices running an Android version lower than 11 (R) are not supported. On these devices, downloading Knox Capture from the Google Play store installs v1.1 instead. All customers should upgrade devices to Android 11 (R) OS binary before v1.2 can be downloaded. Expanded device support In Knox Capture v1.2, support is added for the following devices: Galaxy XCover 4S, Galaxy Tab Active Pro, Galaxy S20, Galaxy S21 Only the keyboard scan icon and floating scan button are supported on non-rugged devices (S20 and S21). For a full list of supported devices, see Supported devices. Keystroke output support in WP-C deployments In previous Knox Capture versions, if an IT admin activated a KPE Premium license with a WP-C deployment, remote injection was blocked in WP-C mode. As a workaround, `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` must be set to True to support keystroke output. With this release, keystroke output in WP-C deployments is supported regardless of whether `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` is set to True. Keystroke output support is not yet available for Galaxy S20 devices. You must use the aforementioned workaround to use keystroke output on Galaxy S20 devices. Option to disable default profile IT admins can now enable or disable the default profile. If you create profiles for several applications and don't want the default profile's behavior to override any configurations, set the default profile to Off. The default profile setting is available on the Knox Capture main page. You can change the configuration at any time, export and deploy it to end users in Managed mode. If a profile is not active for an app or foreground activity and the end user attempts to scan a barcode, an error message is shown stating that the application does not support Knox Capture scanning. This setting cannot be changed in Managed mode. New floating button scan trigger !Hardware scan trigger setting !Hardware scan trigger setting A floating scan button is now available that launches the Knox Capture camera for scanning. By default, the scan button appears in the bottom right corner of the device's screen. Users can move it around the screen, and it remains in the last known position until it's toggled off. The scan button can be used in both Admin and Managed modes. See Set camera trigger for more information on the various available triggers. License activation menu for unmanaged devices Previously, Knox Capture licenses could only be used by organizations pushing them through an MDM. Starting from Knox Capture v1.2, IT admins can now activate Knox Capture licenses in-app using the new license activation menu. To deactivate an entered license key, uninstall the Knox Capture app from your device. The license activation menu is only available in Admin mode. For more information, see Activate your license. Support for exporting large configurations through QR code !Multiple QR code export This Knox Capture version extends the QR code export functionality to support larger configurations. Prior to v1.2, IT admins couldn't select QR code as the export method if the configuration size was too large. Now, multiple QR codes are generated in a PDF file for the end user to scan. The device prompts the user to scan them all before the configuration can be successfully imported to Knox Capture. To learn more, see Export a scanning configuration and Import a scanning configuration. Persistent scan sessions IT admins and end users can now pick up calls, switch apps, and clear tasks during scan sessions without losing scanned data. Rebooting the device has no impact on saved scan data.

Knox Capture v1.8 release notes. New features Knox Capture v1.8 introduces the following new features: #Continuous single scan A new Continuous scanning option appears on the Scan engine settings > Single scan preferences screen. When this option is toggled On, device users can scan several barcodes in sequence - and have each scan be registered as a single event - without having to press the camera trigger button between each scan. To learn more about the Continuous scanning feature, see Single scan preferences. #Scanner overlay In this release, device users have the option to view the camera preview window as an overlay on top of their business app. When the Scanner overlay feature is enabled and a scan is triggered, users will see a mini camera preview window on top of their existing business app screen. To learn more about this new feature, see Scanner overlay. #Inverse color barcode support This release adds a new Performance lab feature that allows users to scan inverse colored barcodes. This feature only works with Data Matrix and QR type barcodes in this release. To enable this option, go to the Knox Capture main screen, then tap the Options button (three dots), tap Performance lab, then enable Inverted color recognition. Enhancements Knox Capture v1.8 includes the following enhancements to existing features: #More intuitive user prompts when connecting USB device Previously, users would get a prompt even if Knox Capture wasn't running in the foreground. For example, a user might want to connect a USB keyboard for use in their business. When connecting the keyboard, they would see a prompt asking if they wanted to use the USB keyboard for scanning purposes, even though they may not be using Knox Capture at the time. This release improves the prompt so that it only shows when Knox Capture is being used in the foreground. The device user must grant system permissions for connected devices in order for the prompt to display. If no permissions are granted, the prompt will not display on any screen. #Seamlessly switch between multiple paired devices in Output path If a user is paired with multiple devices in Knox Capture's Output path, they can now switch between each of their paired devices more easily. Previously, if a user had two paired devices in Output path, and Knox Capture was connected to _device A_, the user would first have to disconnect from _device A_ before connecting to _device B_. With this release, the user simply has to connect to _device B_. Knox Capture automatically disconnects from any previously paired devices. #Receive a notification when overlay is restricted by IT admin Some device users may experience an issue where they are unable to view the camera preview window after triggering a scan. This issue can be caused by a restriction set by the IT admin and the organization's UEM policy. Previously, if the restriction was set, the user would simply not be able to see the preview window. In this release, the user will now get a notification asking them to contact their IT admin for more information. To learn more about the restriction, see the Knox Capture Knowledge Base Article (KBA) related to this issue. Back to release notes

Knox Capture v1.2 release notes. This Knox Capture v1.2 release, scheduled to go live on July 30, 2021, includes several new features and improvements to existing functionality. Starting with Knox Capture v1.2, devices running an Android version lower than 11 (R) are not supported. On these devices, downloading Knox Capture from the Google Play store installs v1.1 instead. All customers should upgrade devices to Android 11 (R) OS binary before v1.2 can be downloaded. Expanded device support In Knox Capture v1.2, support is added for the following devices: Galaxy XCover 4S, Galaxy Tab Active Pro, Galaxy S20, Galaxy S21 Only the keyboard scan icon and floating scan button are supported on non-rugged devices (S20 and S21). For a full list of supported devices, see Supported devices. Keystroke output support in WP-C deployments In previous Knox Capture versions, if an IT admin activated a KPE Premium license with a WP-C deployment, remote injection was blocked in WP-C mode. As a workaround, `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` must be set to True to support keystroke output. With this release, keystroke output in WP-C deployments is supported regardless of whether `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` is set to True. Keystroke output support is not yet available for Galaxy S20 devices. You must use the aforementioned workaround to use keystroke output on Galaxy S20 devices. Option to disable default profile IT admins can now enable or disable the default profile. If you create profiles for several applications and don't want the default profile's behavior to override any configurations, set the default profile to Off. The default profile setting is available on the Knox Capture main page. You can change the configuration at any time, export and deploy it to end users in Managed mode. If a profile is not active for an app or foreground activity and the end user attempts to scan a barcode, an error message is shown stating that the application does not support Knox Capture scanning. This setting cannot be changed in Managed mode. New floating button scan trigger !Hardware scan trigger setting !Hardware scan trigger setting A floating scan button is now available that launches the Knox Capture camera for scanning. By default, the scan button appears in the bottom right corner of the device's screen. Users can move it around the screen, and it remains in the last known position until it's toggled off. The scan button can be used in both Admin and Managed modes. See Set camera trigger for more information on the various available triggers. License activation menu for unmanaged devices Previously, Knox Capture licenses could only be used by organizations pushing them through an MDM. Starting from Knox Capture v1.2, IT admins can now activate Knox Capture licenses in-app using the new license activation menu. To deactivate an entered license key, uninstall the Knox Capture app from your device. The license activation menu is only available in Admin mode. For more information, see Activate your license. Support for exporting large configurations through QR code !Multiple QR code export This Knox Capture version extends the QR code export functionality to support larger configurations. Prior to v1.2, IT admins couldn't select QR code as the export method if the configuration size was too large. Now, multiple QR codes are generated in a PDF file for the end user to scan. The device prompts the user to scan them all before the configuration can be successfully imported to Knox Capture. To learn more, see Export a scanning configuration and Import a scanning configuration. Persistent scan sessions IT admins and end users can now pick up calls, switch apps, and clear tasks during scan sessions without losing scanned data. Rebooting the device has no impact on saved scan data. In multi-scan sessions where the user leaves the business app and returns, they are prompted to either continue the original scan session or begin a new one

For detailed steps on each deactivation method, refer to Deactivate a license. Updated toast message behavior after Knox Capture scan trigge Previously, when a device user tried to initiate a Knox Capture scan with a hardware or software trigger and there was no Knox Capture profile associated with the app activity, the following toast message appeared: [Package name] doesn't support Knox Capture scan This message appeared most frequently in system apps. Starting from v1.3, Knox Capture supports scanning for all system apps. If there is no Knox Capture profile for the app activity, the toast message no longer appears after the device user activates one of the Knox Capture trigger buttons. This behavior applies to both the device camera and any peripheral hardware scanners attached to the device. Support for system apps in scanning profile creation Prior to Knox Capture v1.3, only 3 system apps were allowlisted when selecting apps for scanning profile creation: Samsung Internet, Google Chrome, and Samsung Messages. With this release, you can now select system apps in addition to downloaded apps when creating a profile. On the app selection screen, tap the filter icon and choose to filter the app list by Downloaded apps, System apps, or All. !System apps menu Scanning engine improvements Knox Capture v1.3 adds the following scanning engine and performance enhancements: 1D barcodes with 1px bars are now recognized more easily.

Knox Capture v1.7 release notes. New features #Launch of Samsung Knox Capture The most significant addition to Knox Capture v1.7 is the launch of a brand new, Samsung-developed scan engine that provides the same great feature-set as the Scandit engine, while also laying the foundations for Samsung to deliver exciting, industry-leading features to our customers in future releases. New customers will see an option to select their scan engine preference - either Knox Capture or Knox Capture: Scandit Edition - when launching the app for the first time and accepting the Knox Capture partner agreements. New customers can test the features of Knox Capture, and perform up to 100 free scans during their trial period, after which a valid Knox Suite license is required for commercial use. See Manage Knox Capture licenses to learn more about the new Knox Suite licensing requirements. #Knox Capture SDK This release introduces a brand new Knox Capture SDK to allow Android app developers to create their own barcode scanning applications. To learn more about our Knox Capture SDK, please visit our developer documentation site #Knox Capture AR (Augmented Reality) Version 1.7 of Knox Capture introduces a new AR (augmented reality) feature that displays an overlay on the device screen whenever one or more barcodes are scanned. IT admins can create AR templates to customize the information that displays on the overlay, as well as the overlay behavior. To get started with this exciting new feature, take a look at our Knox Capture AR guide for more information. #Low light scanning notification When using the camera to scan a barcode in low light conditions, a notification now displays in the capture preview window to suggest that the user enable their camera flashlight for better scanning results. This notification is enabled by default, but can be turned off by going to Knox Capture settings > Performance labs > Scanner toast notification. #Vibrate-notification after successful scan IT admins can now configure Knox Capture to vibrate the device after each successful barcode scan. This behavior is disabled by default, but can be enabled by going to a profile's Scan engine settings > Vibrate after scan. Enhancements #Output path accurately displays Paired devices list For customers who use their device as a Bluetooth wedge scanner to connect to a PC or host machine, Knox Capture now displays the Paired devices list only when the Use Bluetooth wedge slider is enabled. Previously, if a Bluetooth device was paired and the slider was in the OFF position, the Paired devices list would still show a list of disconnected devices. Now, the list only displays paired devices (connected or disconnected) if the slider is in the ON position. Known issues #Possible low barcode detection rate in certain glare or tiny conditions Testers have reported that Knox Capture can have difficulties detecting all barcodes under extreme glare conditions. It is recommended that users attempt to block or cover any glare on the barcodes before scanning. For customers who use Code 93 and Code 128 barcodes specifically, Knox Capture may have difficulties scanning barcodes that are too small. It is recommended that customers avoid using tiny barcodes whenver possible to increase the success rate of scans. #Possible difficulties using multiscan from far ranges Testers have reported some difficulties when attempting to scan multiple barcode technologies at the same time, at ranges farther than 16 cm (6 in). It is recommended that users move in closer to the barcodes when using multiscan. Back to release notes

Knox Capture v1.5 release notes. Scanner overlay Starting with Knox Capture v1.5, a scanner overlay is available. This overlay appears as a scanner preview over business apps, and enables device users to immediately see scanned data entered into an app field. Functionally, the scanner overlay works much like the full-screen scanner. When the device user aims the camera at the barcode, Knox Capture then sends the scanned data to the business app depending on whether single scan or multi-scan mode is enabled, and how Barcode selection is configured. See Use the scanner overlay to learn more. Continuous scanning for single scan mode Previously, when device users scanned single barcodes, the camera preview turned on before each scan, then off again once the scan was completed. Now, in Single scan preferences, you can turn on Continuous scanning to scan back-to-back barcodes without relaunching the camera preview after every scan. This feature maximizes worker efficiency when used with a Bluetooth wedge or the scanner overlay. Improvements to configuration behavior after profile mode change With this release, if a Knox Capture profile is pushed to a device in Admin mode through a UEM, the device enters Managed mode and removes any configurations previously applied in Admin mode. For example, consider a device user who's conducting practice scans in Admin mode. Upon receiving a profile configuration, a notification on the device confirms that the configuration updated, and Knox Capture automatically turns off test mode and clears the test results. PDF417 barcode support for default profiles Starting with Knox Capture v1.5, default profiles now include the PDF417 barcode type. The current barcode symbologies enabled in the default profile are: Code 128, QR, Code 39, EAN8, EAN13/UPCA, UPCE, Interleaved 2 of 5, Data Matrix, PDF417 Back to release notes",151

What policy setting prevents the scanner overlay from appearing when launching the camera app?,The UEM policy controlling the DISALLOW_CREATE_WINDOWS boolean., The DISALLOW_CREATE_WINDOWS policy setting is what prevents the scanner overlay from appearing when launching the camera app. The issue occurs when this policy setting is set to true which prevents apps like Knox Capture from creating secondary windows like the scanner overlay. The resolution is to ensure this policy setting is set to false in your UEM profile to allow Knox Capture to show the scanner overlay.,1,1,6,1.0,0.9835325479507446,0,0,35.504571199417114,"Scanning overlay doesn't appear when launching the camera. Overview Some device users experience an issue where they are unable to view the scanner overlay after launching the device's camera for use as a scanner. Cause The issue occurs when the Android Enterprise policy that controls the DISALLOW_CREATE_WINDOWS boolean sets it to true. This boolean specifies whether or not apps can open secondary windows. By default, the value of this boolean is false, allowing apps like Knox Capture to create a window for the scanner overlay every time the camera launches. If a device policy sets this boolean to true, then Knox Capture won't be able to create the scanner overlay window when the camera launches. Resolution Ensure that the policy in your UEM profile that controls this value sets it to the equivalent of false. For Knox Manage customers, set the Create Window policy to Allow. For all other UEMs, refer to their documentation on Android Enterprise policies.

Use scanner overlay. The Scanner overlay feature lets device users view the camera preview window and the business app screen concurrently. When the user triggers a barcode scan, a mini camera preview is shown over the business app screen as a picture-in-picture (PiP) window, allowing users to use the scanner and view their app's data at the same time. Functionally, the Scanner overlay behaves just like the normal scanner. When the device user aims the camera at the barcode, Knox Capture sends the scanned data to the business app depending on how the scan engine settings are configured. Enable the Scanner overlay The Scanner overlay can be enabled in both Admin and Managed modes. To enable this feature, go to the Knox Capture home screen, tap the Options button (three dots), tap Scanner overlay, then toggle the feature On. When you launch the scanner overlay for the first time, an on-screen tutorial explains how to reposition and resize the overlay. By default, the overlay appears at the top of the screen. Any size or position adjustments you make to it are saved for future scanning sessions. Tap the X in the top-right corner to close the Scanner overlay.

What is the unexpected behavior that occurs with out-of-range barcodes in Knox Capture?,"Out-of-range barcodes can still be successfully scanned by Knox Capture, which is unexpected behavior. This occurs when the scan length is set and there are differences between the number of digits or characters and the active symbol count."," The unexpected behavior is that out-of-range barcodes that are too short can still be successfully scanned by Knox Capture. Specifically, the context states:

""Code ""12345"" (length 5) can be successfully scanned. This is unexpected behavior.""

So barcodes that have a length below the configured minimum symbol count range can still be scanned, which is not the intended behavior.",1,1,6,1.0,0.9998565912246704,1,0,5.293242931365967,"Out-of-range barcode still scanned successfully by Knox Capture. Overview For example, assuming you've set a symbol count range of 7 - 20 for Code 128 barcodes, the following situations may occur: Code ""1234567"" (length 7) can be successfully scanned. Code ""12345678"" (length 8) can be successfully scanned. Code ""123456"" (length 6) can't be successfully scanned. Code ""12345"" (length 5) can be successfully scanned. This is unexpected behavior. Code ""1234"" (length 4) can't be successfully scanned. Cause When setting the scan length, there's a difference between the number of digits or characters and the active symbol count. The correlation between characters and symbol counts depends on the encoding standard. For instance, Code 128 differs from Code 39. For Code 128, there are three different encoding schemes that can be mixed within a single Code 128 barcode to achieve the shortest possible code. Resolution Check which encoding standards your barcode data follows.

. For customers who use Code 93 and Code 128 barcodes specifically, Knox Capture may have difficulties scanning barcodes that are too small. It is recommended that customers avoid using tiny barcodes whenver possible to increase the success rate of scans. #Possible difficulties using multiscan from far ranges Testers have reported some difficulties when attempting to scan multiple barcode technologies at the same time, at ranges farther than 16 cm (6 in). It is recommended that users move in closer to the barcodes when using multiscan. Back to release notes

.3.00.7: Samsung Galaxy S21, Samsung Galaxy XCover Pro, Galaxy Tab Active3 You can resolve this issue by sending a Pause command before you send the barcode data. To do this: 1. Refer to the procedure for Advanced data formatting and follow steps 1 - 6. After you tap Add Actions, a list of options opens. 2. Select Send Pause and tap Add. 3. Tap Add Actions again, then select Send remaining characters and tap Add. 4. Verify that the two actions, Send Pause and Send remaining characters, are on the rule screen. 5. Close the Knox Capture app and perform a test scan in Chrome or Samsung Internet. #Enable the Floating Action Button (FAB) You can also resolve this issue by using a Floating Action Button (FAB) instead of the hardware key to perform a scan. To enable the FAB in Knox Capture, refer to step 6 in Set camera scan trigger. #Workaround using another web browser To avoid this issue altogether, you can output your scanned data to a web browser built with a different browser engine, such as Mozilla Firefox.

Scan data is only partially sent to business app. Overview When sending longer barcode data as keystrokes from Knox Capture to a business app, only part of the data can be seen in the business app. Pre-condition This article assumes that the following conditions are met in your Knox Capture scanning profile: 1. Continuous scanning is enabled. This setting is disabled by default. 2. Keystroke output is configured to send scan data as Key events. By default, this value is set to String. Cause When Keystroke data is configured to send as a key event (rather than a string), the processing time is increased. After an internal timer counts down to zero, Knox Capture assumes that all scanned data was delivered successfully to the target field in the business app, and switches the focus back to the scanner overlay. The remaining undelivered data is then sent to the scanner overlay instead of the business app. Resolution In the Knox Capture profile settings, navigate to Keystroke output > Set key event delay and extend the length of time before the foreground focus switches back to the scanner overlay. By default, the key event delay is set to 0 ms. The delay you set occurs between individual key events sent to the business app. For example, when sending scan data that's 10 characters long with a 50 ms key event delay, a 500 ms total delay can be observed.

Overview. Get started with the basics by learning what Knox Capture is and how it works. What is Knox Capture? To help explain what Knox Capture does, it may be helpful to start with an understanding of what a *wedge* scanner is, and how it relates to the Knox Capture solution. In traditional hardware-based barcode scanning terminology, a wedge scanner is a physical device that attaches between a keyboard and a computer. The keyboard attaches to the scanner, and the scanner attaches to the computer. From the computer's perspective, the scanner behaves just like an additional keyboard. When the computer runs a software program (like an inventory spreadsheet app), and barcodes are read using the wedge scanner, data is sent from the scanner to the program in the form of keystrokes. From the program's point of view, data appears exactly as if someone had typed it manually using a keyboard. How Knox Capture works In a similar way, Knox Capture also acts as a wedge between a software program and keyboard

Export and deploy configuration. Knox Capture uses a simple EMM-based deployment model. You first need to export a scanning configuration as a .txt file, then use an EMM add the file to your app configuration to deploy Knox Capture as a managed-app to your end-users. Exporting a configuration Exporting and sharing a scan configuration enables other devices apply the configuration to their installation. #Export options An IT admin can use several methods to export the configuration: Save it as a file on the device. Email it as a file attachment. Use Nearby share to send to another IT admin's device, Generate a QR code that can be scanned by other IT admins. To share a configuration on a per-device basis, transfer the configuration using near-field communication (NFC) or with a QR code. #Launch the export menu Regardless of the export method selected, begin by tapping the Share button in the lower-right of the home page to launch the Share configuration menu. #Save as file To save the file: 1. Tap the Save icon in the Share configuration menu. 2. Enter a name and tap Done. Knox Capture saves the configuration within My Files > Downloads, and displays a success message. #Email file To email the configuration as a text file attachment with the default email program: 1. Tap the email icon within the Share configuration menu. 2. Knox Capture launches the email application and starts a new message with the configuration file attached. #Nearby share To share a configuration with another device using Nearby share: 1. Tap the Nearby icon within the Share configuration menu. 2. Ensure Nearby Share is turned on for both the transmitting and receiving devices. 3. On the receiving device, tap the Device nearby is sharing popup that appears. #QR code To generate a QR code that can be scanned by other devices to import the configuration, tap the QR code option in the Share configuration menu. Knox Capture generates and displays a QR code. Optionally save or email the QR code by tapping either the Save or Email button. Tap Save to save the QR code as an image within the device My Files > Downloads folder. Tap Email to launch the default email app. The resulting email message includes instructions for importing the configuration using the QR code. If the configuration is too large for one QR code, Knox Capture generates multiple QR codes in a PDF file. The end user must scan them all to complete the import process. Deploying through an EMM To deploy Knox Capture with a custom scanning configuration across a fleet of devices, set the scan configuration and use the EMM console to add it to Knox Capture's App Config in Managed Google Play. Doing so ensures devices that the app runs for end-users in Managed mode. Deployment varies depending on the EMM provider, but should resemble the following flow: 1. Install Knox Capture on an admin device, configure the app, and export the configuration as a text file. 2. Add the Knox Capture app to your Managed Google Play Store. 3. Assign the app to a group or organization and launch the app configuration dialog. In most consoles, the app configuration (or App Config) dialog opens as a pop-up window or modal. 4. Activate your license in the EMM. 5. Copy and paste the text of the exported Knox Capture configuration into the provided configuration field. 6. Save the updated settings and deploy. If you do not add a configuration for Knox Capture in Managed Google Play when updating a license key, the app operates according to its _previous_ configuration. For example, a device with an existing scan configuration will continue to operate in Managed mode after updating the license key. However, a new device without an existing configuration will operate in Admin mode. To ensure _all_ devices operate in Managed mode, prepare and include the configuration each time you add or modify the app within the EMM console. Sharing and importing configurations Once a configuration has been exported, it can be shared with other devices running the app in Admin mode

AR overview. The Knox Capture AR (Augmented Reality) is a feature that allows users to view important, business-critical information on the device screen when peforming a barcode scan. Normally, whenever a user launches the scanner, aims their camera at one or more barcodes, and captures the barcode data, Knox Capture simply passes the barcode information back to the business-app for review for the user to review. There is no way for the user to interact with any of the information until it reaches the business-app. To some organizations, scanning several barcodes and reviewing the data only _after_ it reaches the business-app can be inefficient, especially if the information isn't what they were looking for in the first place. This could lead to re-scans and additional worker overhead in order to capture the proper data

Overview. Get started with the basics by learning what Knox Capture is and how it works. What is Knox Capture? To help explain what Knox Capture does, it may be helpful to start with an understanding of what a *wedge* scanner is, and how it relates to the Knox Capture solution. In traditional hardware-based barcode scanning terminology, a wedge scanner is a physical device that attaches between a keyboard and a computer. The keyboard attaches to the scanner, and the scanner attaches to the computer. From the computer's perspective, the scanner behaves just like an additional keyboard. When the computer runs a software program (like an inventory spreadsheet app), and barcodes are read using the wedge scanner, data is sent from the scanner to the program in the form of keystrokes. From the program's point of view, data appears exactly as if someone had typed it manually using a keyboard. How Knox Capture works In a similar way, Knox Capture also acts as a wedge between a software program and keyboard",798

What are some examples of barcodes that could be used to test the Knox Capture AR features?,"The following barcodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 can be used to test the Knox Capture AR features."," The context provides some examples of barcodes that could be used to test the Knox Capture AR features:

Barcode 1 Barcode 2 Barcode 3 Barcode 4 Barcode 5 Barcode 6",1,1,6,1.0,0.9999115467071533,1,0,2.8683769702911377,"AR demo barcodes. Use the following barcodes to test the Knox Capture AR features. Barcode 1 Barcode 2 Barcode 3 Barcode 4 Barcode 5 Barcode 6

AR overview. The Knox Capture AR (Augmented Reality) is a feature that allows users to view important, business-critical information on the device screen when peforming a barcode scan. Normally, whenever a user launches the scanner, aims their camera at one or more barcodes, and captures the barcode data, Knox Capture simply passes the barcode information back to the business-app for review for the user to review. There is no way for the user to interact with any of the information until it reaches the business-app. To some organizations, scanning several barcodes and reviewing the data only _after_ it reaches the business-app can be inefficient, especially if the information isn't what they were looking for in the first place. This could lead to re-scans and additional worker overhead in order to capture the proper data. When a user triggers a barcode scan using Knox Capture AR, the camera preview window gets augmented with a customizable overlay that allows the user to view, analyze, and interact with the barcode data in real-time. For example, a retail worker using AR to scan an item could view information like the product's model number, sale price, or remaining inventory count, all from within the camera preview window, without ever having to open their business app to review the data. About AR templates Just like how scanning profiles define core Knox Capture behavior like which apps can trigger a scan, which barcodes are accepted, and what happens to data after it gets captured, AR templates also define the characteristics and behaviors of the Knox Capture AR feature. #Search-and-find templates This AR template provides an overlay to help users locate and isolate a single barcode when several similar barcodes are in the camera preview window. For example, a retail worker may be asked to locate a single box from a large wall of boxes in a warehouse. Using Knox Capture AR, the worker can start by scanning a reference barcode of the item they're searching for. After the reference barcode is scanned, the worker simply needs to point their camera at the wall of boxes in the warehouse. Knox Capture AR then analyzes each barcode in view, looking for a match. When a match is found, the AR overlay highlights the barcode, and additional product information is provided to the worker for review. #View-and-update templates This AR template provides an overlay to allow users to view product information and make real-time updates to a product database whenever a barcode is scanned. For example, a retail worker may want to know if there is enough inventory of a certain item before making a large-quantity transaction. Using Knox Capture AR, the worker can scan one of the items to bring up additional product information in the AR overlay. The worker can then see how many items are available in stock, and (after making the sale) immediately update their product database with a new stock count in real-time. See also , Refer to the Configure Knox Capture AR guide for instructions on creating Search-and-find and View-and-update AR templates as an IT admin. Refer to the Use Knox Capture AR guide for instructions on how to use AR templates to scan barcodes as an IT admin or end-user.

Tap Start search, then aim the camera at one or more barcodes to begin your search. 4. If Knox Capture AR finds a matching barcode, it will be highlighed blue in the overlay. If multiple reference barcodes are found, multiple highlights appear in the overlay. 5. Tap End search to exit AR mode. Use View-and-update To use a View-and-update AR template: 1. Aim the camera at a barcode, then tap Freeze. Product information displays in the overlay. Tap the > icon to view full product details. 2.

Configure apps and activities. Each Knox Capture profile supports a set of apps to which its scanner and keystroke output settings apply. IT admins can set more refined control over each scanning context within an app by associating individual Android activities with different Knox Capture profiles. A user interacts with an Android activity within an app's UI, such as a user data form or search input. Refer to the Android developer documentation for more information about activities. Depending on deployment requirements, consider configuring one profile for all apps. Or, set up a unique profile for each device app. Or, associate a group of apps or activities with one profile. For example, within the *same* app, consider associating: A user data form with one profile that appends a Tab key event to scanned data, A search input field with a profile that appends an Enter key event A single profile can have numerous apps or activities, but a single activity can only belong to one profile. Add activities Add app activities to control business app scan behavior. There are several ways to add activities: 1. Add app activities all at once 2. Add individual activities visually 3. Add individual activities from the app activity list view To begin adding activities, either create a new profile or open an existing profile to edit and select a target app. When working with a custom business app, consider asking your team for a descriptive list of all the Android activities within the app, as this is a good way to find and associate activities quickly within Knox Capture. Add all activities at once To add apps as a single activity: 1. Tap the radio button to the left of the app name within the Select applications list. 2. An app can also be selected by tapping its name, then tapping the All button at the upper-left of the app activities list. Add individual activities visually To add individual apps visually: 1.

Knox Capture saves the configuration within My Files > Downloads, and displays a success message. #Email file To email the configuration as a text file attachment with the default email program: 1. Tap the email icon within the Share configuration menu. 2. Knox Capture launches the email application and starts a new message with the configuration file attached. #Nearby share To share a configuration with another device using Nearby share: 1. Tap the Nearby icon within the Share configuration menu. 2. Ensure Nearby Share is turned on for both the transmitting and receiving devices. 3. On the receiving device, tap the Device nearby is sharing popup that appears. #QR code To generate a QR code that can be scanned by other devices to import the configuration, tap the QR code option in the Share configuration menu. Knox Capture generates and displays a QR code. Optionally save or email the QR code by tapping either the Save or Email button. Tap Save to save the QR code as an image within the device My Files > Downloads folder. Tap Email to launch the default email app. The resulting email message includes instructions for importing the configuration using the QR code. If the configuration is too large for one QR code, Knox Capture generates multiple QR codes in a PDF file. The end user must scan them all to complete the import process. Deploying through an EMM To deploy Knox Capture with a custom scanning configuration across a fleet of devices, set the scan configuration and use the EMM console to add it to Knox Capture's App Config in Managed Google Play. Doing so ensures devices that the app runs for end-users in Managed mode. Deployment varies depending on the EMM provider, but should resemble the following flow: 1. Install Knox Capture on an admin device, configure the app, and export the configuration as a text file. 2. Add the Knox Capture app to your Managed Google Play Store. 3. Assign the app to a group or organization and launch the app configuration dialog. In most consoles, the app configuration (or App Config) dialog opens as a pop-up window or modal. 4. Activate your license in the EMM. 5. Copy and paste the text of the exported Knox Capture configuration into the provided configuration field. 6. Save the updated settings and deploy. If you do not add a configuration for Knox Capture in Managed Google Play when updating a license key, the app operates according to its _previous_ configuration. For example, a device with an existing scan configuration will continue to operate in Managed mode after updating the license key. However, a new device without an existing configuration will operate in Admin mode. To ensure _all_ devices operate in Managed mode, prepare and include the configuration each time you add or modify the app within the EMM console. Sharing and importing configurations Once a configuration has been exported, it can be shared with other devices running the app in Admin mode

. 3. Export profile settings as a configuration file, which can then be used by EMM/UEM administrators to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to end-user devices. #Managed mode After an IT admin uses their EMM/UEM to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to an end-user's device, the device launches the app in Managed mode. In Managed mode, Knox Capture functionality is greatly reduced. End-users can review their scanning profile settings and perform barcode scans using their business apps (as permitted by their scanning profile), however they can't make changes to their scanning profiles, export profile settings, or switch to Admin mode by activating a Knox Capture license. Admin mode is the default mode of operation for Knox Capture. The procedures described in this guide are targeted at an IT admin audience.

The following tutorial is intended for IT admins, and guides you through the basics of Knox Capture using the default scanning profile as a starting point. Step 1: Download, install, and launch the app Knox Capture is available to download from Google Play. As mentioned in the Knox Capture Overview, the app runs in admin mode by default. End-users who wish to use Knox Capture must have the app deployed to their devices through an EMM/UEM. After installing and launching Knox Capture for the first time, it presents you with links to all of the applicable Terms, Conditions, and privacy policies. Review these, and if you agree to all of the documents, tap Agree. From the Knox Capture home screen, you can review or dismiss the in-app tips for new users, and access the Knox Capture options by tapping the menu button (three dots) near the top-right next to the search icon. Step 2: Edit the default profile Tap Default scanning profile to explore and edit the profile settings. Note that you cannot change the profile's App list, as the default scanning profile works with all apps on the device. Review Scanning profiles for more information. Step 3: Change scan engine settings On the Default scanning profile screen, tap Knox Capture in the Scanner field to view or change the scan engine settings. In this example, you'll learn how to: Update the profile's list of supported barcode types. Enable a flashlight button during a barcode scan. To change these scan engine settings: 1. Tap Barcode types, then scroll down to review the selected types. Upon creation, profiles automatically use Code 128, Code 39, DataMatrix, EAN8, Interleaved 2 of 5, QR, UPCA, and UPCE. Add or remove a barcode type of your choice. For best performance, only select the barcode types necessary when creating the profile. 2. Tap Save to return to the Scan engine settings screen. 3. Scroll down to Camera Settings, then enable the Flashlight button by moving the slider to the right. 4. Tap < Scan engine settings to return to the Default scanning profile screen. Step 4: Set keystroke output rules The last step in component of a Knox Capture profile keystroke output rules. In this example, you'll set rules to append an Enter keystroke to the scanned data. To do this: 1. Expand the Keystroke output options, then tap Send Enter character as. 2. In the pop-up, select Key event. This emulates a user hitting the Enter key on their keyboard after they type characters into a field. 3. Tap Save to return to the Keystroke output options. 4. Scroll down to Basic data formatting, then expand the options. 5. Enable the Append Enter character option by moving the slider to the right. 6. Tap < Default scanning profile to return to the home screen. Step 5: Test your profile After making the modifications to your profile, you can test your Knox Capture to ensure that your barcode types, flashlight, and keystroke output rules were configured properly. In this example, you'll use Samsung Internet to test the configuration. 1. On the home screen, tap the options icon in the top-right next to the search icon, then tap Test apps. After starting the test mode, a system pop-up notification indicates that Test mode is on. 2. Select the Samsung Internet app from the Test apps list, then tap Open. 3. Tap your browser's search field to bring up the device's on-screen keyboard. Tap the Knox Capture icon near the top-left side of the keyboard to trigger a scan. Optionally, if you are using a rugged device like an XCover Pro, trigger a scan with the Scan trigger hardware key. 4. Test the flashlight by tapping the button near the top-left corner of the screen. 5. Aim the camera at a barcode to scan. The barcode will automatically scan once in focus,unless the barcode wasn't selected in the profile. 6. Review the scanned data in the test overlay. You'll see the following values: Output - The processed data in test mode notation with keystroke output rules applied. Scanned - The scanned barcode data in test mode notation without any keystroke output rules applied

. If you create profiles for several applications and don't want the default profile's behavior to override any configurations, set the default profile to Off. The default profile setting is available on the Knox Capture main page. You can change the configuration at any time, export and deploy it to end users in Managed mode. If a profile is not active for an app or foreground activity and the end user attempts to scan a barcode, an error message is shown stating that the application does not support Knox Capture scanning. This setting cannot be changed in Managed mode. New floating button scan trigger !Hardware scan trigger setting !Hardware scan trigger setting A floating scan button is now available that launches the Knox Capture camera for scanning.

Describe an example of how you could set up multiple Knox Capture profiles within a single app to handle scanning contexts differently.,"One example of setting up multiple Knox Capture profiles within a single app would be to use a profile that appends a Tab key event to scanned data for a user data form, while using one that appends an Enter key event for a search input field within that same app."," The question asks how Knox Capture profiles can be set up to handle different scanning contexts within the same app:

Within the same app, consider associating: A user data form with one profile that appends a Tab key event to scanned data, A search input field with a profile that appends an Enter key event. A single profile can have numerous apps or activities, but a single activity can only belong to one profile. So within a single app, multiple Knox Capture profiles can be configured, with each profile associated with specific activities in the app UI, such as a data form or search field. The profiles would be set up differently, for example with different keystroke settings, to handle the scanning context appropriately. This allows granular control over scanning behavior on a per-activity level within the app.",1,1,6,1.0,0.9998557567596436,1,0,13.900680780410767,"Configure apps and activities. Each Knox Capture profile supports a set of apps to which its scanner and keystroke output settings apply. IT admins can set more refined control over each scanning context within an app by associating individual Android activities with different Knox Capture profiles. A user interacts with an Android activity within an app's UI, such as a user data form or search input. Refer to the Android developer documentation for more information about activities. Depending on deployment requirements, consider configuring one profile for all apps. Or, set up a unique profile for each device app. Or, associate a group of apps or activities with one profile. For example, within the *same* app, consider associating: A user data form with one profile that appends a Tab key event to scanned data, A search input field with a profile that appends an Enter key event A single profile can have numerous apps or activities, but a single activity can only belong to one profile

Scanning profiles. Knox Capture acts as a wedge by translating barcode data into keystrokes that can be sent to a business application. But how does Knox Capture know what barcode types to scan, how to interpret scanned data, and which business applications to pass the data to? For Knox Capture, the *Scanning profile* defines the app's core behavior. A Scanning Profile is a configuration file that gets created or modified by an IT admin using the Knox Capture application. The profile defines how Knox Capture performs a barcode scan, and primarily consists of the following parameters: 1. Apps and activities - define which applications that can launch the Knox Capture scanner. 2. Scanner engine settings - specifying the barcode technologies (QR, Code 128, UPCA, etc.), scanning methods (single barcode, multi barcode), and camera behavior (enable flash, allow camera zoom). 3. Keystroke output rules - specifying how barcode data gets converted into keystrokes (append Tab or Enter character to each barcode, add prefix or suffix characters, convert output to hex characters, etc.) Default scanning profile Out-of-the-box, Knox Capture includes a default scanning profile that gets automatically associated with all apps on the device. In other words, when Knox Capture is launched, *any* app can trigger the camera scanner and receive barcode data in the form of keystrokes. This makes it easy to use Knox Capture for basic scanning purposes without any additional setup. When using the default scanning profile, IT admins can change the profile's scan engine settings and data processing rules, however they cannot change the default profile's apps and activities behavior. For example, an IT admin can modify the default profile to append a Tab key at the end of each barcode, but they cannot change which apps can trigger the scanner. Custom scanning profiles While the default scanning profile allows Knox Capture to be used right away without any configuration, IT admins may want to use a custom profile to better suit their needs. With a custom profile, IT admins control which apps and activities can trigger a barcode scan. Any apps that you don't select in the custom profile will follow the default behavior in that the barcode scanner is active for all apps not specified in the custom profile. Creating custom scanning profiles Custom profiles can be created by modifying the default profile settings, or by creating entirely new profiles altogether. 1. Tap the + button near the top of the app UI to open the profile creation options. 2. Select Create profile to start a profile from scratch, or select Duplicate existing profile to copy the settings from an existing (custom or default) profile. Alternatively, you can create a custom profile by clicking Create profile without clicking the + button. 3. Provide a profile name, then tap Done. The new profile appears in the profiles area below Defult scanning profile.

Configure apps and activities. Each Knox Capture profile supports a set of apps to which its scanner and keystroke output settings apply. IT admins can set more refined control over each scanning context within an app by associating individual Android activities with different Knox Capture profiles. A user interacts with an Android activity within an app's UI, such as a user data form or search input. Refer to the Android developer documentation for more information about activities. Depending on deployment requirements, consider configuring one profile for all apps. Or, set up a unique profile for each device app. Or, associate a group of apps or activities with one profile. For example, within the *same* app, consider associating: A user data form with one profile that appends a Tab key event to scanned data, A search input field with a profile that appends an Enter key event A single profile can have numerous apps or activities, but a single activity can only belong to one profile. Add activities Add app activities to control business app scan behavior. There are several ways to add activities: 1. Add app activities all at once 2. Add individual activities visually 3. Add individual activities from the app activity list view To begin adding activities, either create a new profile or open an existing profile to edit and select a target app. When working with a custom business app, consider asking your team for a descriptive list of all the Android activities within the app, as this is a good way to find and associate activities quickly within Knox Capture. Add all activities at once To add apps as a single activity: 1. Tap the radio button to the left of the app name within the Select applications list. 2. An app can also be selected by tapping its name, then tapping the All button at the upper-left of the app activities list. Add individual activities visually To add individual apps visually: 1. Within the app activities list page, tap the wand icon in the upper-right corner to launch the visual selection tool. 2. If this is the first time using the visual selection tool, a series of pop-up messages display with information on selecting activities. Tap anywhere on the screen to advance the pop-ups. If the visual selection tool has been previously invoked, the pop-up messages do not display. 3. Navigate within the app to locate an activity. A blue selector overlay (pictured above) displays on each screen to name the activity associated with that screen. Drag this selector around the screen as needed to view the app user interface. 4. To select an activity, tap the radio button next to the activity name within the blue overlay. As activities are added, the counter in the overlay, next to the DONE button, increments with each selection. 5. When completed adding activities, tap DONE to navigate back to the app activities list page. Add individual activities from the activities list 1. Locate an activity to add within the app activities list page. If you know the name of the activity, tap the magnifying glass located on the upper-right of the screen to enter a search term. 2. Tap the radio button to the left of each activity you would like to add.

. 2. Scanner engine settings - specifying the barcode technologies (QR, Code 128, UPCA, etc.), scanning methods (single barcode, multi barcode), and camera behavior (enable flash, allow camera zoom). 3. Keystroke output rules - specifying how barcode data gets converted into keystrokes (append Tab or Enter character to each barcode, add prefix or suffix characters, convert output to hex characters, etc.) Default scanning profile Out-of-the-box, Knox Capture includes a default scanning profile that gets automatically associated with all apps on the device.

The profile defines how Knox Capture performs a barcode scan, and primarily consists of the following parameters: 1. Apps and activities - define which applications that can launch the Knox Capture scanner. 2. Scanner engine settings - specifying the barcode technologies (QR, Code 128, UPCA, etc.), scanning methods (single barcode, multi barcode), and camera behavior (enable flash, allow camera zoom). 3

. This could lead to re-scans and additional worker overhead in order to capture the proper data. When a user triggers a barcode scan using Knox Capture AR, the camera preview window gets augmented with a customizable overlay that allows the user to view, analyze, and interact with the barcode data in real-time. For example, a retail worker using AR to scan an item could view information like the product's model number, sale price, or remaining inventory count, all from within the camera preview window, without ever having to open their business app to review the data. About AR templates Just like how scanning profiles define core Knox Capture behavior like which apps can trigger a scan, which barcodes are accepted, and what happens to data after it gets captured, AR templates also define the characteristics and behaviors of the Knox Capture AR feature",826

Configure apps and activities. Each Knox Capture profile supports a set of apps to which its scanner and keystroke output settings apply. IT admins can set more refined control over each scanning context within an app by associating individual Android activities with different Knox Capture profiles. A user interacts with an Android activity within an app's UI, such as a user data form or search input. Refer to the Android developer documentation for more information about activities. Depending on deployment requirements, consider configuring one profile for all apps. Or, set up a unique profile for each device app. Or, associate a group of apps or activities with one profile. For example, within the *same* app, consider associating: A user data form with one profile that appends a Tab key event to scanned data, A search input field with a profile that appends an Enter key event A single profile can have numerous apps or activities, but a single activity can only belong to one profile.

Keystroke output support in WP-C deployments In previous Knox Capture versions, if an IT admin activated a KPE Premium license with a WP-C deployment, remote injection was blocked in WP-C mode. As a workaround, `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` must be set to True to support keystroke output. With this release, keystroke output in WP-C deployments is supported regardless of whether `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` is set to True. Keystroke output support is not yet available for Galaxy S20 devices. You must use the aforementioned workaround to use keystroke output on Galaxy S20 devices.

Configure keystroke output and data formatting. Knox Capture sends scanned data to business apps as keystrokes, imitating the way a user manually enters data using a keyboard. If you activate a KPE (Knox Platform for Enterprise) Premium license with a Galaxy S20 device in WP-C mode, you must set `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` to True in your EMM. Enabling this policy allows keystroke output to function as expected. Keystroke output Refer to the following settings to modify scanned data and format its output: Setting Description Options Default Send Enter character as Sets the output format for all existing and appended Enters Key event &mdash; Sends Enter as a key event. String &mdash; Sends Enter as ASCII Line Feed 0x0A. Both String and Key event &mdash; Sends Enter as ASCII Line Feed 0x0A and key event. None &mdash; Sends no output for Enter.

Keystroke output data sent to browser or web app instead of business app. Overview Certain company-owned devices with a work profile might encounter an issue where barcode data sent through keystroke output is delivered to a browser or web app instead of the business app. Cause With recent improvements to company-owned devices with a work profile, a change was made to the way web apps - apps delivered through the browser instead of natively on Android - handle text view focus after scanning. On devices running Android 10 and lower, the text view is already in focus when scanned data returns to the business app. This focus behavior is no longer required with company-owned devices with a work profile running Android 11 and higher. Resolution To handle this change, you must enable the Allow remote control policy in your EMM to allow Knox Capture to restore focus to the text view. You only need to enable this policy if you've activated a Knox Platform for Enterprise Premium license.

Overview. Get started with the basics by learning what Knox Capture is and how it works. What is Knox Capture? To help explain what Knox Capture does, it may be helpful to start with an understanding of what a *wedge* scanner is, and how it relates to the Knox Capture solution. In traditional hardware-based barcode scanning terminology, a wedge scanner is a physical device that attaches between a keyboard and a computer. The keyboard attaches to the scanner, and the scanner attaches to the computer. From the computer's perspective, the scanner behaves just like an additional keyboard. When the computer runs a software program (like an inventory spreadsheet app), and barcodes are read using the wedge scanner, data is sent from the scanner to the program in the form of keystrokes. From the program's point of view, data appears exactly as if someone had typed it manually using a keyboard. How Knox Capture works In a similar way, Knox Capture also acts as a wedge between a software program and keyboard

Deactivate a license If a device is inactive for 180 days, its Knox Capture license assignment is automatically released. If Knox Capture records activity on the device after 180 days have elapsed, the server automatically handles reactivation. Knox Capture offers the following ways to deactivate your license: Using the Device Deactivation tool, Through your EMM, By uninstalling the Knox Capture app Performing a factory reset on a device does not automatically deactivate its Knox Capture license. #Using the Device Deactivation tool Like Knox Platform for Enterprise and Knox Suite license keys, Knox Capture license keys can be deactivated using the Device Deactivation tool in the Knox Admin Portal. Note that you need a list of device IMEIs to either deactivate or keep. For steps on how to access and use the Device Deactivation tool, see How to disassociate a device from a Knox license key. #Through your EMM If you activated your license through app configuration in your EMM, you can use one of the following methods to deactivate your license: Push an uninstallation command for the Knox Capture app. Once the device receives the command, the Knox Capture app is removed and its license seat is unassigned. Edit the license field in the Knox Capture app configuration. On the app configuration screen in your EMM, replace the existing license key string with DEACTIVATE and save your changes. Once the Knox Capture agent detects the new string, the license is deactivated. Before editing the license field, verify whether you are targeting the correct devices in your EMM. Failure to do so may cause all your devices to be unenrolled from Knox Capture. Unenroll the device from your EMM. Doing so forces an app uninstallation and releases the device's license seat",253

Deploying through an EMM To deploy Knox Capture with a custom scanning configuration across a fleet of devices, set the scan configuration and use the EMM console to add it to Knox Capture's App Config in Managed Google Play. Doing so ensures devices that the app runs for end-users in Managed mode. Deployment varies depending on the EMM provider, but should resemble the following flow: 1. Install Knox Capture on an admin device, configure the app, and export the configuration as a text file. 2. Add the Knox Capture app to your Managed Google Play Store. 3. Assign the app to a group or organization and launch the app configuration dialog. In most consoles, the app configuration (or App Config) dialog opens as a pop-up window or modal. 4. Activate your license in the EMM. 5. Copy and paste the text of the exported Knox Capture configuration into the provided configuration field. 6. Save the updated settings and deploy. If you do not add a configuration for Knox Capture in Managed Google Play when updating a license key, the app operates according to its _previous_ configuration. For example, a device with an existing scan configuration will continue to operate in Managed mode after updating the license key. However, a new device without an existing configuration will operate in Admin mode. To ensure _all_ devices operate in Managed mode, prepare and include the configuration each time you add or modify the app within the EMM console. Sharing and importing configurations Once a configuration has been exported, it can be shared with other devices running the app in Admin mode

What manifest file needs to be edited to allow a business app to parse scanned data from Knox Capture?,AndroidManifest.xml, No relevant context.,1,1,6,1.0,7.658939284738153e-05,0,0,7.4783406257629395,". For business app developers #Edit the AndroidManifest.xml file For your business app to parse the scanned data, you need to set up Knox Capture to send it the correct intent output. To do so, edit AndroidManifest.xml to define the package name, intent action and category. Knox Capture offers three different methods for your app to receive an Android intent. Refer to Intent output settings for more details. The following is a snippet demonstrating the manifest information to edit. Ensure you replace any dummy strings with ones relevant to your app. ``` PackageName = applicationId ""com.test.smartscan"" AndroidManifest.xml ``` If you're using an activity to receive the intent: ``` ``` If you're using the foreground service to receive the intent: ``` ``` If you're using the broadcast receiver to receive the intent: ``` ``` Properly defining the intent filter information ensures that after each successful scan, Knox Capture delivers the intent to your business app through the chosen method

Use intent output. If your business app needs to obtain scanned data programmatically (for example, to process it further in-app), Knox Capture can pass the data within an Android intent object instead of through keystroke output. You can also enable intent output to work with keystroke output. For example, if you select Send via startActivity as your intent delivery method, Knox Capture first sends keystrokes to the foreground activity, then sends the intent to the new activity instance. To use Knox Capture's intent output feature: Business app developers must ensure the business app receives the intent, and, IT admins must configure Knox Capture's Intent output feature accordingly. The information in this section is divided into instructions for business app developers and instructions for Knox Capture admins.

If test mode is active, the intent is not sent and the business app is not launched. Instead, the following error message appears, notifying you that test mode is active: `Not Start Activity in TestMode!` The key/value pair that signifies test mode status is as follows: ``` Key:= ProfileConstants.KEY_INTENT_TEST_MODE=""intent_in_testmode"" Value:= true/false : whether Knox Capture test mode is on. ``` ##The list of scanned bundles The key/value pair that contains the scanned barcode data is as follows: ``` Key:= ProfileConstants.INTENT_OUTPUT_SCANNED_BUNDLE_LIST= ""com.samsung.smartscan.scanned_bundle_list"" Value:= bundle list : the scanned barcode data const val INTENT_OUTPUT_UNPROCESSED_RAW_DATA = ""com.samsung.smartscan.unprocessed_raw_data"" const val INTENT_OUTPUT_UNPROCESSED_STRING_DATA = ""com.samsung.smartscan.unprocessed_string_data"" const val INTENT_OUTPUT_SYMBLOGY_TYPE = ""com.samsung.smartscan.symblogy_type"" const val INTENT_OUTPUT_SCAN_SOURCE = ""com.samsung.smartscan.scan_source"" const val INTENT_OUTPUT_SCANNER_TYPE = ""com.samsung.smartscan.scanner_type"" ``` ##The bundle structure ``` const val KEY_SCANNER_TYPE_CAMERA = ""camera"" ``` #Reading the intent output information The following code snippet, written in Kotlin, demonstrates how to get and read the data sent from Knox Capture. ``` fun getAllExtraInfo(intent: Intent):String bundleItem.getString(INTENT_OUTPUT_SCAN_SOURCE)?.let bundleItem.getString(INTENT_OUTPUT_SYMBLOGY_TYPE)?.let bundleItem.getStringArrayList(INTENT_OUTPUT_UNPROCESSED_STRING_DATA)?.let }, \n"") } bundleItem.getByteArray(INTENT_OUTPUT_UNPROCESSED_RAW_DATA)?.let "") } sb.append(""]"") } sb.append(""}"") } return sb.toString() } ``` #Knox Capture configuration You must instruct the IT admin to configure the same package and intent delivery method as specified in the AndroidManifest.xml file. The following example demonstrates how the IT admin should configure Knox Capture if the intent is received when starting a new activity

Scanning profiles. Knox Capture acts as a wedge by translating barcode data into keystrokes that can be sent to a business application. But how does Knox Capture know what barcode types to scan, how to interpret scanned data, and which business applications to pass the data to? For Knox Capture, the *Scanning profile* defines the app's core behavior. A Scanning Profile is a configuration file that gets created or modified by an IT admin using the Knox Capture application. The profile defines how Knox Capture performs a barcode scan, and primarily consists of the following parameters: 1. Apps and activities - define which applications that can launch the Knox Capture scanner. 2. Scanner engine settings - specifying the barcode technologies (QR, Code 128, UPCA, etc.), scanning methods (single barcode, multi barcode), and camera behavior (enable flash, allow camera zoom). 3. Keystroke output rules - specifying how barcode data gets converted into keystrokes (append Tab or Enter character to each barcode, add prefix or suffix characters, convert output to hex characters, etc.) Default scanning profile Out-of-the-box, Knox Capture includes a default scanning profile that gets automatically associated with all apps on the device. In other words, when Knox Capture is launched, *any* app can trigger the camera scanner and receive barcode data in the form of keystrokes. This makes it easy to use Knox Capture for basic scanning purposes without any additional setup. When using the default scanning profile, IT admins can change the profile's scan engine settings and data processing rules, however they cannot change the default profile's apps and activities behavior. For example, an IT admin can modify the default profile to append a Tab key at the end of each barcode, but they cannot change which apps can trigger the scanner. Custom scanning profiles While the default scanning profile allows Knox Capture to be used right away without any configuration, IT admins may want to use a custom profile to better suit their needs. With a custom profile, IT admins control which apps and activities can trigger a barcode scan. Any apps that you don't select in the custom profile will follow the default behavior in that the barcode scanner is active for all apps not specified in the custom profile. Creating custom scanning profiles Custom profiles can be created by modifying the default profile settings, or by creating entirely new profiles altogether. 1. Tap the + button near the top of the app UI to open the profile creation options. 2. Select Create profile to start a profile from scratch, or select Duplicate existing profile to copy the settings from an existing (custom or default) profile. Alternatively, you can create a custom profile by clicking Create profile without clicking the + button. 3. Provide a profile name, then tap Done. The new profile appears in the profiles area below Defult scanning profile.

. Scanned raw - The scanned barcode data in hexadecimal format without any keystroke output rules applied. 7. Inspect and compare the Scanned data to the Output data to ensure you've set the correct keystroke output rules. Repeat this test with other apps as required. 8. Exit test mode tapping X in the top-right corner of the test overlay, then in the confirmation pop-up, tap Close to return to the Test apps list. Step 6: Export configuration After editing your profiles, you can export the configuration as a .txt file. This configuration file can be shared with other Knox Capture IT admins, or it can be used in your EMM/UEM to deploy Knox Capture as a managed-app to end-users. To export a scanning configuration: 1. On the home screen, tap the Share button in the lower-right corner. 2. In the pop-up, seelct Email, then select your preferred email app. The configuration file is automatically attached. 3. After sending the email with the configuration file attached, re-launch Knox Capture. You should see a notification confirming the email submission followed by the date and time. Step 7: Deploy Knox Capture using an EMM/UEM You have now configured a basic Knox Capture configuration and exported it as an email attachment. The only thing left to do is use the configuration to deploy Knox Capture as a managed-app to your end-users. Actual deployment steps vary depending on the EMM provider, but they should generally resemble the following: 1. Add the Knox Capture app to your Managed Google Play Store. 2. Assign the app to a group or organization and launch the app configuration dialog. In a typical console, the app configuration dialog opens as a pop-up window or modal. 3. Activate the license by pasting it into the field within the app configuration (App Config) screen. 4. Copy and paste the exported configuration into the provided app configuration field. Adding a configuration to Managed Google Play is the only step necessary to ensure all devices installing the app operate in Managed mode. However, if you're using a trial version of Knox Capture, you'll need to push a Knox Suite license key as well. Refer to the following table for details on the configuration data: Configuration key , Configuration type , Configuration value - , - , - smartscan_license , String , Knox license key smartscan_config , String , Exported configuration data from Knox Capture 5. Save the updated settings and deploy. Summary You have now completed a typical Knox Capture workflow for IT admins, and have been introduced to configuring and deploying the app to managed devices. For more information, browse the how-to guides for detailed instructions for each feature.

Export and deploy configuration. Knox Capture uses a simple EMM-based deployment model. You first need to export a scanning configuration as a .txt file, then use an EMM add the file to your app configuration to deploy Knox Capture as a managed-app to your end-users. Exporting a configuration Exporting and sharing a scan configuration enables other devices apply the configuration to their installation. #Export options An IT admin can use several methods to export the configuration: Save it as a file on the device. Email it as a file attachment. Use Nearby share to send to another IT admin's device, Generate a QR code that can be scanned by other IT admins. To share a configuration on a per-device basis, transfer the configuration using near-field communication (NFC) or with a QR code. #Launch the export menu Regardless of the export method selected, begin by tapping the Share button in the lower-right of the home page to launch the Share configuration menu. #Save as file To save the file: 1. Tap the Save icon in the Share configuration menu. 2. Enter a name and tap Done. Knox Capture saves the configuration within My Files > Downloads, and displays a success message. #Email file To email the configuration as a text file attachment with the default email program: 1. Tap the email icon within the Share configuration menu. 2. Knox Capture launches the email application and starts a new message with the configuration file attached. #Nearby share To share a configuration with another device using Nearby share: 1. Tap the Nearby icon within the Share configuration menu. 2. Ensure Nearby Share is turned on for both the transmitting and receiving devices. 3. On the receiving device, tap the Device nearby is sharing popup that appears. #QR code To generate a QR code that can be scanned by other devices to import the configuration, tap the QR code option in the Share configuration menu. Knox Capture generates and displays a QR code. Optionally save or email the QR code by tapping either the Save or Email button. Tap Save to save the QR code as an image within the device My Files > Downloads folder. Tap Email to launch the default email app. The resulting email message includes instructions for importing the configuration using the QR code. If the configuration is too large for one QR code, Knox Capture generates multiple QR codes in a PDF file. The end user must scan them all to complete the import process. Deploying through an EMM To deploy Knox Capture with a custom scanning configuration across a fleet of devices, set the scan configuration and use the EMM console to add it to Knox Capture's App Config in Managed Google Play. Doing so ensures devices that the app runs for end-users in Managed mode. Deployment varies depending on the EMM provider, but should resemble the following flow: 1. Install Knox Capture on an admin device, configure the app, and export the configuration as a text file. 2. Add the Knox Capture app to your Managed Google Play Store. 3. Assign the app to a group or organization and launch the app configuration dialog. In most consoles, the app configuration (or App Config) dialog opens as a pop-up window or modal. 4. Activate your license in the EMM. 5. Copy and paste the text of the exported Knox Capture configuration into the provided configuration field. 6. Save the updated settings and deploy. If you do not add a configuration for Knox Capture in Managed Google Play when updating a license key, the app operates according to its _previous_ configuration. For example, a device with an existing scan configuration will continue to operate in Managed mode after updating the license key. However, a new device without an existing configuration will operate in Admin mode. To ensure _all_ devices operate in Managed mode, prepare and include the configuration each time you add or modify the app within the EMM console. Sharing and importing configurations Once a configuration has been exported, it can be shared with other devices running the app in Admin mode

Use intent output. If your business app needs to obtain scanned data programmatically (for example, to process it further in-app), Knox Capture can pass the data within an Android intent object instead of through keystroke output. You can also enable intent output to work with keystroke output. For example, if you select Send via startActivity as your intent delivery method, Knox Capture first sends keystrokes to the foreground activity, then sends the intent to the new activity instance. To use Knox Capture's intent output feature: Business app developers must ensure the business app receives the intent, and, IT admins must configure Knox Capture's Intent output feature accordingly. The information in this section is divided into instructions for business app developers and instructions for Knox Capture admins.

How could allowing users to view important information directly in the AR interface when scanning barcodes improve efficiency for some organizations?,"By allowing users to view important information directly in the AR interface when scanning barcodes, organizations could increase efficiency by reducing the need for additional scans and allowing for quicker data verification, reducing worker overhead and potentially reducing instances of incorrectly scanned data that needs to be re-scanned.","

Using AR templates, Knox Capture AR provides an augmented reality overlay that allows users to view important product information like model number, sale price, or inventory count directly in the camera preview window when scanning barcodes. This can improve efficiency for organizations by eliminating the need to open a separate business app to review scanned data that may not even be what the user is looking for.

. #Search-and-find templates This AR template provides an overlay to help users locate and isolate a single barcode when several similar barcodes are in the camera preview window. For example, a retail worker may be asked to locate a single box from a large wall of boxes in a warehouse. Using Knox Capture AR, the worker can start by scanning a reference barcode of the item they're searching for. After the reference barcode is scanned, the worker simply needs to point their camera at the wall of boxes in the warehouse. Knox Capture AR then analyzes each barcode in view, looking for a match. When a match is found, the AR overlay highlights the barcode, and additional product information is provided to the worker for review. #View-and-update templates This AR template provides an overlay to allow users to view product information and make real-time updates to a product database whenever a barcode is scanned

AR overview. The Knox Capture AR (Augmented Reality) is a feature that allows users to view important, business-critical information on the device screen when peforming a barcode scan. Normally, whenever a user launches the scanner, aims their camera at one or more barcodes, and captures the barcode data, Knox Capture simply passes the barcode information back to the business-app for review for the user to review. There is no way for the user to interact with any of the information until it reaches the business-app. To some organizations, scanning several barcodes and reviewing the data only _after_ it reaches the business-app can be inefficient, especially if the information isn't what they were looking for in the first place. This could lead to re-scans and additional worker overhead in order to capture the proper data. When a user triggers a barcode scan using Knox Capture AR, the camera preview window gets augmented with a customizable overlay that allows the user to view, analyze, and interact with the barcode data in real-time. For example, a retail worker using AR to scan an item could view information like the product's model number, sale price, or remaining inventory count, all from within the camera preview window, without ever having to open their business app to review the data. About AR templates Just like how scanning profiles define core Knox Capture behavior like which apps can trigger a scan, which barcodes are accepted, and what happens to data after it gets captured, AR templates also define the characteristics and behaviors of the Knox Capture AR feature. #Search-and-find templates This AR template provides an overlay to help users locate and isolate a single barcode when several similar barcodes are in the camera preview window. For example, a retail worker may be asked to locate a single box from a large wall of boxes in a warehouse. Using Knox Capture AR, the worker can start by scanning a reference barcode of the item they're searching for. After the reference barcode is scanned, the worker simply needs to point their camera at the wall of boxes in the warehouse. Knox Capture AR then analyzes each barcode in view, looking for a match. When a match is found, the AR overlay highlights the barcode, and additional product information is provided to the worker for review. #View-and-update templates This AR template provides an overlay to allow users to view product information and make real-time updates to a product database whenever a barcode is scanned. For example, a retail worker may want to know if there is enough inventory of a certain item before making a large-quantity transaction. Using Knox Capture AR, the worker can scan one of the items to bring up additional product information in the AR overlay. The worker can then see how many items are available in stock, and (after making the sale) immediately update their product database with a new stock count in real-time. See also , Refer to the Configure Knox Capture AR guide for instructions on creating Search-and-find and View-and-update AR templates as an IT admin.

What feature can help improve scan performance when reading direct part marked (DPM) Data Matrix codes?,Direct part marking mode,"

The feature that can help improve scan performance when reading direct part marked (DPM) Data Matrix codes is the ""Direct part marking mode"" setting. The context says: 

""Direct part marking mode Improves scan performance when reading direct part marked (DPM) Data Matrix codes. Please note that this setting increases frame processing times. Samsung recommends restricting the scanning area to a smaller portion of the screen for better performance when using direct part marking mode.""

So enabling the ""Direct part marking mode"" setting in the extended barcode type settings can improve scan performance for direct part marked Data Matrix codes. However, it also increases frame processing times, so restricting the scan area is recommended.",1,1,6,1.0,0.9994611144065857,1,0,32.59800839424133,".

Out-of-range barcode still scanned successfully by Knox Capture. Overview For example, assuming you've set a symbol count range of 7 - 20 for Code 128 barcodes, the following situations may occur: Code ""1234567"" (length 7) can be successfully scanned. Code ""12345678"" (length 8) can be successfully scanned. Code ""123456"" (length 6) can't be successfully scanned. Code ""12345"" (length 5) can be successfully scanned. This is unexpected behavior. Code ""1234"" (length 4) can't be successfully scanned. Cause When setting the scan length, there's a difference between the number of digits or characters and the active symbol count. The correlation between characters and symbol counts depends on the encoding standard. For instance, Code 128 differs from Code 39. For Code 128, there are three different encoding schemes that can be mixed within a single Code 128 barcode to achieve the shortest possible code. Resolution Check which encoding standards your barcode data follows.

. Change this property to include lengths not enabled by default, or to optimize decoding performance for a certain number of symbols. Character-to-symbol mapping depends on barcode type. For example, some barcodes include additional checksum characters in their symbol counts. For more information on active symbol count, refer to Configure the Active Symbol Count.

Scanning profiles. Knox Capture acts as a wedge by translating barcode data into keystrokes that can be sent to a business application. But how does Knox Capture know what barcode types to scan, how to interpret scanned data, and which business applications to pass the data to? For Knox Capture, the *Scanning profile* defines the app's core behavior. A Scanning Profile is a configuration file that gets created or modified by an IT admin using the Knox Capture application. The profile defines how Knox Capture performs a barcode scan, and primarily consists of the following parameters: 1. Apps and activities - define which applications that can launch the Knox Capture scanner. 2. Scanner engine settings - specifying the barcode technologies (QR, Code 128, UPCA, etc.), scanning methods (single barcode, multi barcode), and camera behavior (enable flash, allow camera zoom). 3. Keystroke output rules - specifying how barcode data gets converted into keystrokes (append Tab or Enter character to each barcode, add prefix or suffix characters, convert output to hex characters, etc.) Default scanning profile Out-of-the-box, Knox Capture includes a default scanning profile that gets automatically associated with all apps on the device. In other words, when Knox Capture is launched, *any* app can trigger the camera scanner and receive barcode data in the form of keystrokes. This makes it easy to use Knox Capture for basic scanning purposes without any additional setup. When using the default scanning profile, IT admins can change the profile's scan engine settings and data processing rules, however they cannot change the default profile's apps and activities behavior. For example, an IT admin can modify the default profile to append a Tab key at the end of each barcode, but they cannot change which apps can trigger the scanner. Custom scanning profiles While the default scanning profile allows Knox Capture to be used right away without any configuration, IT admins may want to use a custom profile to better suit their needs. With a custom profile, IT admins control which apps and activities can trigger a barcode scan. Any apps that you don't select in the custom profile will follow the default behavior in that the barcode scanner is active for all apps not specified in the custom profile. Creating custom scanning profiles Custom profiles can be created by modifying the default profile settings, or by creating entirely new profiles altogether. 1. Tap the + button near the top of the app UI to open the profile creation options. 2. Select Create profile to start a profile from scratch, or select Duplicate existing profile to copy the settings from an existing (custom or default) profile. Alternatively, you can create a custom profile by clicking Create profile without clicking the + button. 3. Provide a profile name, then tap Done. The new profile appears in the profiles area below Defult scanning profile.",416

New license deactivation methods Knox Capture v1.3 introduces three new ways to deactivate a license. You can trigger license deactivation by uninstalling the Knox Capture app, modifying the License field within your EMM's app configuration screen, or by entering the associated device's IMEI in your Knox dashboard. Knox Capture license seats are also automatically released after 180 days of device inactivity, ensuring that any seats associated with lost or unused devices can be reused. For detailed steps on each deactivation method, refer to Deactivate a license. Updated toast message behavior after Knox Capture scan trigge Previously, when a device user tried to initiate a Knox Capture scan with a hardware or software trigger and there was no Knox Capture profile associated with the app activity, the following toast message appeared: [Package name] doesn't support Knox Capture scan This message appeared most frequently in system apps. Starting from v1.3, Knox Capture supports scanning for all system apps. If there is no Knox Capture profile for the app activity, the toast message no longer appears after the device user activates one of the Knox Capture trigger buttons. This behavior applies to both the device camera and any peripheral hardware scanners attached to the device. Support for system apps in scanning profile creation Prior to Knox Capture v1.3, only 3 system apps were allowlisted when selecting apps for scanning profile creation: Samsung Internet, Google Chrome, and Samsung Messages. With this release, you can now select system apps in addition to downloaded apps when creating a profile. On the app selection screen, tap the filter icon and choose to filter the app list by Downloaded apps, System apps, or All. !System apps menu Scanning engine improvements Knox Capture v1.3 adds the following scanning engine and performance enhancements: 1D barcodes with 1px bars are now recognized more easily.

Knox Capture v1.8 release notes. New features Knox Capture v1.8 introduces the following new features: #Continuous single scan A new Continuous scanning option appears on the Scan engine settings > Single scan preferences screen. When this option is toggled On, device users can scan several barcodes in sequence - and have each scan be registered as a single event - without having to press the camera trigger button between each scan. To learn more about the Continuous scanning feature, see Single scan preferences. #Scanner overlay In this release, device users have the option to view the camera preview window as an overlay on top of their business app. When the Scanner overlay feature is enabled and a scan is triggered, users will see a mini camera preview window on top of their existing business app screen. To learn more about this new feature, see Scanner overlay. #Inverse color barcode support This release adds a new Performance lab feature that allows users to scan inverse colored barcodes. This feature only works with Data Matrix and QR type barcodes in this release. To enable this option, go to the Knox Capture main screen, then tap the Options button (three dots), tap Performance lab, then enable Inverted color recognition. Enhancements Knox Capture v1.8 includes the following enhancements to existing features: #More intuitive user prompts when connecting USB device Previously, users would get a prompt even if Knox Capture wasn't running in the foreground. For example, a user might want to connect a USB keyboard for use in their business. When connecting the keyboard, they would see a prompt asking if they wanted to use the USB keyboard for scanning purposes, even though they may not be using Knox Capture at the time. This release improves the prompt so that it only shows when Knox Capture is being used in the foreground. The device user must grant system permissions for connected devices in order for the prompt to display. If no permissions are granted, the prompt will not display on any screen. #Seamlessly switch between multiple paired devices in Output path If a user is paired with multiple devices in Knox Capture's Output path, they can now switch between each of their paired devices more easily. Previously, if a user had two paired devices in Output path, and Knox Capture was connected to _device A_, the user would first have to disconnect from _device A_ before connecting to _device B_. With this release, the user simply has to connect to _device B_. Knox Capture automatically disconnects from any previously paired devices. #Receive a notification when overlay is restricted by IT admin Some device users may experience an issue where they are unable to view the camera preview window after triggering a scan. This issue can be caused by a restriction set by the IT admin and the organization's UEM policy. Previously, if the restriction was set, the user would simply not be able to see the preview window. In this release, the user will now get a notification asking them to contact their IT admin for more information. To learn more about the restriction, see the Knox Capture Knowledge Base Article (KBA) related to this issue. Back to release notes

. 2. Scanner engine settings - specifying the barcode technologies (QR, Code 128, UPCA, etc.), scanning methods (single barcode, multi barcode), and camera behavior (enable flash, allow camera zoom). 3. Keystroke output rules - specifying how barcode data gets converted into keystrokes (append Tab or Enter character to each barcode, add prefix or suffix characters, convert output to hex characters, etc.) Default scanning profile Out-of-the-box, Knox Capture includes a default scanning profile that gets automatically associated with all apps on the device. In other words, when Knox Capture is launched, *any* app can trigger the camera scanner and receive barcode data in the form of keystrokes. This makes it easy to use Knox Capture for basic scanning purposes without any additional setup. When using the default scanning profile, IT admins can change the profile's scan engine settings and data processing rules, however they cannot change the default profile's apps and activities behavior

Scanning profiles. Knox Capture acts as a wedge by translating barcode data into keystrokes that can be sent to a business application. But how does Knox Capture know what barcode types to scan, how to interpret scanned data, and which business applications to pass the data to? For Knox Capture, the *Scanning profile* defines the app's core behavior. A Scanning Profile is a configuration file that gets created or modified by an IT admin using the Knox Capture application. The profile defines how Knox Capture performs a barcode scan, and primarily consists of the following parameters: 1. Apps and activities - define which applications that can launch the Knox Capture scanner. 2. Scanner engine settings - specifying the barcode technologies (QR, Code 128, UPCA, etc.), scanning methods (single barcode, multi barcode), and camera behavior (enable flash, allow camera zoom). 3. Keystroke output rules - specifying how barcode data gets converted into keystrokes (append Tab or Enter character to each barcode, add prefix or suffix characters, convert output to hex characters, etc.) Default scanning profile Out-of-the-box, Knox Capture includes a default scanning profile that gets automatically associated with all apps on the device. In other words, when Knox Capture is launched, *any* app can trigger the camera scanner and receive barcode data in the form of keystrokes. This makes it easy to use Knox Capture for basic scanning purposes without any additional setup. When using the default scanning profile, IT admins can change the profile's scan engine settings and data processing rules, however they cannot change the default profile's apps and activities behavior. For example, an IT admin can modify the default profile to append a Tab key at the end of each barcode, but they cannot change which apps can trigger the scanner. Custom scanning profiles While the default scanning profile allows Knox Capture to be used right away without any configuration, IT admins may want to use a custom profile to better suit their needs. With a custom profile, IT admins control which apps and activities can trigger a barcode scan. Any apps that you don't select in the custom profile will follow the default behavior in that the barcode scanner is active for all apps not specified in the custom profile. Creating custom scanning profiles Custom profiles can be created by modifying the default profile settings, or by creating entirely new profiles altogether. 1. Tap the + button near the top of the app UI to open the profile creation options. 2. Select Create profile to start a profile from scratch, or select Duplicate existing profile to copy the settings from an existing (custom or default) profile. Alternatively, you can create a custom profile by clicking Create profile without clicking the + button. 3. Provide a profile name, then tap Done. The new profile appears in the profiles area below Defult scanning profile.

Knox Capture v1.5 release notes. Scanner overlay Starting with Knox Capture v1.5, a scanner overlay is available. This overlay appears as a scanner preview over business apps, and enables device users to immediately see scanned data entered into an app field. Functionally, the scanner overlay works much like the full-screen scanner. When the device user aims the camera at the barcode, Knox Capture then sends the scanned data to the business app depending on whether single scan or multi-scan mode is enabled, and how Barcode selection is configured. See Use the scanner overlay to learn more. Continuous scanning for single scan mode Previously, when device users scanned single barcodes, the camera preview turned on before each scan, then off again once the scan was completed. Now, in Single scan preferences, you can turn on Continuous scanning to scan back-to-back barcodes without relaunching the camera preview after every scan. This feature maximizes worker efficiency when used with a Bluetooth wedge or the scanner overlay. Improvements to configuration behavior after profile mode change With this release, if a Knox Capture profile is pushed to a device in Admin mode through a UEM, the device enters Managed mode and removes any configurations previously applied in Admin mode. For example, consider a device user who's conducting practice scans in Admin mode. Upon receiving a profile configuration, a notification on the device confirms that the configuration updated, and Knox Capture automatically turns off test mode and clears the test results. PDF417 barcode support for default profiles Starting with Knox Capture v1.5, default profiles now include the PDF417 barcode type. The current barcode symbologies enabled in the default profile are: Code 128, QR, Code 39, EAN8, EAN13/UPCA, UPCE, Interleaved 2 of 5, Data Matrix, PDF417 Back to release notes",182

Enhancements Knox Capture v1.8 includes the following enhancements to existing features: #More intuitive user prompts when connecting USB device Previously, users would get a prompt even if Knox Capture wasn't running in the foreground. For example, a user might want to connect a USB keyboard for use in their business. When connecting the keyboard, they would see a prompt asking if they wanted to use the USB keyboard for scanning purposes, even though they may not be using Knox Capture at the time. This release improves the prompt so that it only shows when Knox Capture is being used in the foreground. The device user must grant system permissions for connected devices in order for the prompt to display. If no permissions are granted, the prompt will not display on any screen. #Seamlessly switch between multiple paired devices in Output path If a user is paired with multiple devices in Knox Capture's Output path, they can now switch between each of their paired devices more easily. Previously, if a user had two paired devices in Output path, and Knox Capture was connected to _device A_, the user would first have to disconnect from _device A_ before connecting to _device B_. With this release, the user simply has to connect to _device B_. Knox Capture automatically disconnects from any previously paired devices. #Receive a notification when overlay is restricted by IT admin Some device users may experience an issue where they are unable to view the camera preview window after triggering a scan. This issue can be caused by a restriction set by the IT admin and the organization's UEM policy. Previously, if the restriction was set, the user would simply not be able to see the preview window. In this release, the user will now get a notification asking them to contact their IT admin for more information.

What policy technology do IT admins use to push the barcode scanning business app profile to enterprise devices?,IT admins push the barcode scanning business app profile to enterprise devices through their Enterprise Mobile Management (EMM) technology.," The relevant sentences from the context are:

Once the IT admin has configured the profile, they push it to enterprise devices through their EMM.

EMM/UEM administrators to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to end-user devices.

So the IT admins use an EMM (Enterprise Mobility Management) or UEM (Unified Endpoint Management) technology to push the barcode scanning business app and profile to enterprise devices.",1,2,6,0.5,0.9997327923774719,1,0,6.8143150806427,"How do I know if this app is right for my enterprise? . Knox Capture supports a variety of use cases, and works best when paired with an EMM for deployment, configuration, and license activation. A dedicated app manager, like an IT admin, is required to configure Knox Capture for business apps.

. Once the IT admin has configured the profile, they push it to enterprise devices through their EMM. Device users can then start using the business app to scan barcodes.

. When using the default scanning profile, IT admins can change the profile's scan engine settings and data processing rules, however they cannot change the default profile's apps and activities behavior. For example, an IT admin can modify the default profile to append a Tab key at the end of each barcode, but they cannot change which apps can trigger the scanner. Custom scanning profiles While the default scanning profile allows Knox Capture to be used right away without any configuration, IT admins may want to use a custom profile to better suit their needs. With a custom profile, IT admins control which apps and activities can trigger a barcode scan. Any apps that you don't select in the custom profile will follow the default behavior in that the barcode scanner is active for all apps not specified in the custom profile. Creating custom scanning profiles Custom profiles can be created by modifying the default profile settings, or by creating entirely new profiles altogether. 1

Overview. Get started with the basics by learning what Knox Capture is and how it works. What is Knox Capture? To help explain what Knox Capture does, it may be helpful to start with an understanding of what a *wedge* scanner is, and how it relates to the Knox Capture solution. In traditional hardware-based barcode scanning terminology, a wedge scanner is a physical device that attaches between a keyboard and a computer. The keyboard attaches to the scanner, and the scanner attaches to the computer. From the computer's perspective, the scanner behaves just like an additional keyboard. When the computer runs a software program (like an inventory spreadsheet app), and barcodes are read using the wedge scanner, data is sent from the scanner to the program in the form of keystrokes. From the program's point of view, data appears exactly as if someone had typed it manually using a keyboard. How Knox Capture works In a similar way, Knox Capture also acts as a wedge between a software program and keyboard. However, instead of being a physical scanning device, Knox Capture is a mobile solution built for compatible Android smartphones and tablets. Enterprise IT admins can either download the Knox Capture app from Google Play, or custom-build their own wedge scanner apps using the Knox Capture SDK (Software Development Kit). Once Knox Capture is installed and running on a device, it *wedges* between an application (for example, a business app used to track inventory) and the mobile device's on-screen keyboard. When an end-user launches their business app, they can simply tap an on-screen button or press a hardware button on their device to trigger a barcode scan using the device's camera. After the camera focuses on a barcode, Knox Capture translates the barcode data into keystrokes, which then get passed back to the business app for processing. From the business app's point of view, keystrokes coming from Knox Capture appear exactly as if a user had typed them from the device keyboard. Who can use Knox Capture? Knox Capture is designed for anyone who wants to turn their mobile device into a powerful barcode scanner. However, depending on whether it's being used by an admin or an end-user, its features vary significantly. #Admin mode (Default) When Knox Capture is downloaded from Google Play and installed on a compatible Android device - and a valid license key is activated - the app operates in its default Admin mode. This mode allows the device user - typically an enterprise IT admin - to utilize the full functionality of the app to primarily do the following: 1. Create scanning profiles that define which apps can launch the barcode scanner, which barcode types can be scanned (QR, Code 128, EAN8, etc.), and how scanned data is formatted (append Tab or Enter key, insert special characters before or after data, etc.). 2. Test scanning profiles to ensure that appropriate business apps can launch the scanner and receive data back as keystrokes. 3. Export profile settings as a configuration file, which can then be used by EMM/UEM administrators to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to end-user devices. #Managed mode After an IT admin uses their EMM/UEM to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to an end-user's device, the device launches the app in Managed mode. In Managed mode, Knox Capture functionality is greatly reduced. End-users can review their scanning profile settings and perform barcode scans using their business apps (as permitted by their scanning profile), however they can't make changes to their scanning profiles, export profile settings, or switch to Admin mode by activating a Knox Capture license. Admin mode is the default mode of operation for Knox Capture. The procedures described in this guide are targeted at an IT admin audience.

Keystroke output data sent to browser or web app instead of business app. Overview Certain company-owned devices with a work profile might encounter an issue where barcode data sent through keystroke output is delivered to a browser or web app instead of the business app. Cause With recent improvements to company-owned devices with a work profile, a change was made to the way web apps - apps delivered through the browser instead of natively on Android - handle text view focus after scanning. On devices running Android 10 and lower, the text view is already in focus when scanned data returns to the business app. This focus behavior is no longer required with company-owned devices with a work profile running Android 11 and higher. Resolution To handle this change, you must enable the Allow remote control policy in your EMM to allow Knox Capture to restore focus to the text view. You only need to enable this policy if you've activated a Knox Platform for Enterprise Premium license.

Export and deploy configuration. Knox Capture uses a simple EMM-based deployment model. You first need to export a scanning configuration as a .txt file, then use an EMM add the file to your app configuration to deploy Knox Capture as a managed-app to your end-users. Exporting a configuration Exporting and sharing a scan configuration enables other devices apply the configuration to their installation. #Export options An IT admin can use several methods to export the configuration: Save it as a file on the device. Email it as a file attachment. Use Nearby share to send to another IT admin's device, Generate a QR code that can be scanned by other IT admins. To share a configuration on a per-device basis, transfer the configuration using near-field communication (NFC) or with a QR code. #Launch the export menu Regardless of the export method selected, begin by tapping the Share button in the lower-right of the home page to launch the Share configuration menu. #Save as file To save the file: 1. Tap the Save icon in the Share configuration menu. 2. Enter a name and tap Done. Knox Capture saves the configuration within My Files > Downloads, and displays a success message. #Email file To email the configuration as a text file attachment with the default email program: 1. Tap the email icon within the Share configuration menu. 2. Knox Capture launches the email application and starts a new message with the configuration file attached. #Nearby share To share a configuration with another device using Nearby share: 1. Tap the Nearby icon within the Share configuration menu. 2. Ensure Nearby Share is turned on for both the transmitting and receiving devices. 3. On the receiving device, tap the Device nearby is sharing popup that appears. #QR code To generate a QR code that can be scanned by other devices to import the configuration, tap the QR code option in the Share configuration menu. Knox Capture generates and displays a QR code. Optionally save or email the QR code by tapping either the Save or Email button. Tap Save to save the QR code as an image within the device My Files > Downloads folder. Tap Email to launch the default email app. The resulting email message includes instructions for importing the configuration using the QR code. If the configuration is too large for one QR code, Knox Capture generates multiple QR codes in a PDF file. The end user must scan them all to complete the import process. Deploying through an EMM To deploy Knox Capture with a custom scanning configuration across a fleet of devices, set the scan configuration and use the EMM console to add it to Knox Capture's App Config in Managed Google Play. Doing so ensures devices that the app runs for end-users in Managed mode. Deployment varies depending on the EMM provider, but should resemble the following flow: 1. Install Knox Capture on an admin device, configure the app, and export the configuration as a text file. 2. Add the Knox Capture app to your Managed Google Play Store. 3. Assign the app to a group or organization and launch the app configuration dialog. In most consoles, the app configuration (or App Config) dialog opens as a pop-up window or modal. 4. Activate your license in the EMM. 5. Copy and paste the text of the exported Knox Capture configuration into the provided configuration field. 6. Save the updated settings and deploy. If you do not add a configuration for Knox Capture in Managed Google Play when updating a license key, the app operates according to its _previous_ configuration. For example, a device with an existing scan configuration will continue to operate in Managed mode after updating the license key. However, a new device without an existing configuration will operate in Admin mode. To ensure _all_ devices operate in Managed mode, prepare and include the configuration each time you add or modify the app within the EMM console.

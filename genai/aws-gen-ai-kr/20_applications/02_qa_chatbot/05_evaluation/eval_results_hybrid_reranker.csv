What are the key differences in functionality between Knox Capture in Admin mode versus Managed mode?,"In managed mode, Knox Capture functionality is limited, as end-users cannot make changes to their scanning profiles, export profile settings, or activate a Knox Capture license to switch to Admin mode."," Please note that I skipped the preamble and XML tags.

The key differences in functionality between Knox Capture in Admin mode versus Managed mode are:

Admin mode:
- Allows the device user (typically an enterprise IT admin) to utilize the full functionality of the app, including creating and editing scanning profiles, testing profiles, and exporting profile settings. 
- Default mode of operation when the app is downloaded from Google Play and a valid license key is activated.

Managed mode:  
- Functionality is greatly reduced for end-users. 
- End-users can review scanning profile settings and perform barcode scans using permitted business apps, but can't make changes to profiles, export settings, or switch to Admin mode.
- Automatically applied when Knox Capture is configured by an IT admin and deployed through an EMM console.

So in summary, Admin mode provides full control and customization for IT admins, while Managed mode locks down the app's functionality for end-users.",1,1,6,1.0,0.9971464276313782,1.0,0,15.241611003875732,". 3. Export profile settings as a configuration file, which can then be used by EMM/UEM administrators to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to end-user devices. #Managed mode After an IT admin uses their EMM/UEM to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to an end-user's device, the device launches the app in Managed mode. In Managed mode, Knox Capture functionality is greatly reduced. End-users can review their scanning profile settings and perform barcode scans using their business apps (as permitted by their scanning profile), however they can't make changes to their scanning profiles, export profile settings, or switch to Admin mode by activating a Knox Capture license. Admin mode is the default mode of operation for Knox Capture. The procedures described in this guide are targeted at an IT admin audience.

. #Admin mode (Default) When Knox Capture is downloaded from Google Play and installed on a compatible Android device - and a valid license key is activated - the app operates in its default Admin mode. This mode allows the device user - typically an enterprise IT admin - to utilize the full functionality of the app to primarily do the following: 1. Create scanning profiles that define which apps can launch the barcode scanner, which barcode types can be scanned (QR, Code 128, EAN8, etc.), and how scanned data is formatted (append Tab or Enter key, insert special characters before or after data, etc.). 2. Test scanning profiles to ensure that appropriate business apps can launch the scanner and receive data back as keystrokes. 3. Export profile settings as a configuration file, which can then be used by EMM/UEM administrators to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to end-user devices

How do I enforce Managed mode on enterprise devices . Managed mode is automatically applied when Knox Capture is configured and deployed through an EMM console. For details on deploying the app in Managed mode, see Deployment.

Overview. Get started with the basics by learning what Knox Capture is and how it works. What is Knox Capture? To help explain what Knox Capture does, it may be helpful to start with an understanding of what a *wedge* scanner is, and how it relates to the Knox Capture solution. In traditional hardware-based barcode scanning terminology, a wedge scanner is a physical device that attaches between a keyboard and a computer. The keyboard attaches to the scanner, and the scanner attaches to the computer. From the computer's perspective, the scanner behaves just like an additional keyboard. When the computer runs a software program (like an inventory spreadsheet app), and barcodes are read using the wedge scanner, data is sent from the scanner to the program in the form of keystrokes. From the program's point of view, data appears exactly as if someone had typed it manually using a keyboard. How Knox Capture works In a similar way, Knox Capture also acts as a wedge between a software program and keyboard. However, instead of being a physical scanning device, Knox Capture is a mobile solution built for compatible Android smartphones and tablets. Enterprise IT admins can either download the Knox Capture app from Google Play, or custom-build their own wedge scanner apps using the Knox Capture SDK (Software Development Kit). Once Knox Capture is installed and running on a device, it *wedges* between an application (for example, a business app used to track inventory) and the mobile device's on-screen keyboard. When an end-user launches their business app, they can simply tap an on-screen button or press a hardware button on their device to trigger a barcode scan using the device's camera. After the camera focuses on a barcode, Knox Capture translates the barcode data into keystrokes, which then get passed back to the business app for processing. From the business app's point of view, keystrokes coming from Knox Capture appear exactly as if a user had typed them from the device keyboard. Who can use Knox Capture? Knox Capture is designed for anyone who wants to turn their mobile device into a powerful barcode scanner. However, depending on whether it's being used by an admin or an end-user, its features vary significantly. #Admin mode (Default) When Knox Capture is downloaded from Google Play and installed on a compatible Android device - and a valid license key is activated - the app operates in its default Admin mode. This mode allows the device user - typically an enterprise IT admin - to utilize the full functionality of the app to primarily do the following: 1.

. Intent action - Designates an action to handle the intent. Intent category - Sets the category of the intent action. Intent delivery - Selects one of three delivery methods for intent-based data: 1. Send via startActivity - Launches the activity to pass data through. 2. Send via startForeground - Creates a foreground service from an activity or app component to pass data through. This option is only available for devices running Android 8 and above. 3. Broadcast Intent - Gives the business app's broadcast receiver foreground priority on the device to speed up data delivery. Use this delivery method only if you're experiencing delays when sending scanned data immediately after the device is booted. After you configure an Android intent, the intent delivery method is added to the blue test overlay in Test mode. Refer to Use test mode for steps on how to check your configuration.

. #What's included in the intent output After a successful scan, the configured intent triggers and is sent to the business app along with the following key information. ##Test mode status If Send via startActivity is selected as the intent delivery, test mode can be affected. If test mode is active, the intent is not sent and the business app is not launched. Instead, the following error message appears, notifying you that test mode is active: `Not Start Activity in TestMode!` The key/value pair that signifies test mode status is as follows: ``` Key:= ProfileConstants.KEY_INTENT_TEST_MODE=""intent_in_testmode"" Value:= true/false : whether Knox Capture test mode is on. ``` ##The list of scanned bundles The key/value pair that contains the scanned barcode data is as follows: ``` Key:= ProfileConstants.INTENT_OUTPUT_SCANNED_BUNDLE_LIST= ""com.samsung.smartscan.scanned_bundle_list"" Value:= bundle list : the scanned barcode data const val INTENT_OUTPUT_UNPROCESSED_RAW_DATA = ""com.samsung.smartscan

Keystroke output data sent to browser or web app instead of business app. Overview Certain company-owned devices with a work profile might encounter an issue where barcode data sent through keystroke output is delivered to a browser or web app instead of the business app. Cause With recent improvements to company-owned devices with a work profile, a change was made to the way web apps - apps delivered through the browser instead of natively on Android - handle text view focus after scanning. On devices running Android 10 and lower, the text view is already in focus when scanned data returns to the business app. This focus behavior is no longer required with company-owned devices with a work profile running Android 11 and higher. Resolution To handle this change, you must enable the Allow remote control policy in your EMM to allow Knox Capture to restore focus to the text view. You only need to enable this policy if you've activated a Knox Platform for Enterprise Premium license.",297

. Scanned raw - The scanned barcode data in hexadecimal format without any keystroke output rules applied. 7. Inspect and compare the Scanned data to the Output data to ensure you've set the correct keystroke output rules. Repeat this test with other apps as required. 8. Exit test mode tapping X in the top-right corner of the test overlay, then in the confirmation pop-up, tap Close to return to the Test apps list. Step 6: Export configuration After editing your profiles, you can export the configuration as a .txt file. This configuration file can be shared with other Knox Capture IT admins, or it can be used in your EMM/UEM to deploy Knox Capture as a managed-app to end-users. To export a scanning configuration: 1. On the home screen, tap the Share button in the lower-right corner. 2. In the pop-up, seelct Email, then select your preferred email app. The configuration file is automatically attached. 3. After sending the email with the configuration file attached, re-launch Knox Capture. You should see a notification confirming the email submission followed by the date and time. Step 7: Deploy Knox Capture using an EMM/UEM You have now configured a basic Knox Capture configuration and exported it as an email attachment. The only thing left to do is use the configuration to deploy Knox Capture as a managed-app to your end-users. Actual deployment steps vary depending on the EMM provider, but they should generally resemble the following: 1. Add the Knox Capture app to your Managed Google Play Store. 2. Assign the app to a group or organization and launch the app configuration dialog. In a typical console, the app configuration dialog opens as a pop-up window or modal. 3. Activate the license by pasting it into the field within the app configuration (App Config) screen. 4. Copy and paste the exported configuration into the provided app configuration field. Adding a configuration to Managed Google Play is the only step necessary to ensure all devices installing the app operate in Managed mode. However, if you're using a trial version of Knox Capture, you'll need to push a Knox Suite license key as well. Refer to the following table for details on the configuration data: Configuration key , Configuration type , Configuration value - , - , - smartscan_license , String , Knox license key smartscan_config , String , Exported configuration data from Knox Capture 5. Save the updated settings and deploy. Summary You have now completed a typical Knox Capture workflow for IT admins, and have been introduced to configuring and deploying the app to managed devices.

What type of configuration settings allow IT admins to append key events after barcode scans in Knox Capture?,Knox Capture includes keystroke output rules that IT admins can use to append key events after a barcode scan.,"

The keystroke output rules in Knox Capture scanning profiles allow IT admins to append key events after barcode scans. Specifically, the keystroke output settings specify how barcode data gets converted into keystrokes, including options to append Tab or Enter characters to each barcode.",0,0,6,0.0,0.9999227523803711,1.0,0,5.333121299743652,". When using the default scanning profile, IT admins can change the profile's scan engine settings and data processing rules, however they cannot change the default profile's apps and activities behavior. For example, an IT admin can modify the default profile to append a Tab key at the end of each barcode, but they cannot change which apps can trigger the scanner. Custom scanning profiles While the default scanning profile allows Knox Capture to be used right away without any configuration, IT admins may want to use a custom profile to better suit their needs. With a custom profile, IT admins control which apps and activities can trigger a barcode scan. Any apps that you don't select in the custom profile will follow the default behavior in that the barcode scanner is active for all apps not specified in the custom profile. Creating custom scanning profiles Custom profiles can be created by modifying the default profile settings, or by creating entirely new profiles altogether. 1

. 2. Scanner engine settings - specifying the barcode technologies (QR, Code 128, UPCA, etc.), scanning methods (single barcode, multi barcode), and camera behavior (enable flash, allow camera zoom). 3. Keystroke output rules - specifying how barcode data gets converted into keystrokes (append Tab or Enter character to each barcode, add prefix or suffix characters, convert output to hex characters, etc.) Default scanning profile Out-of-the-box, Knox Capture includes a default scanning profile that gets automatically associated with all apps on the device. In other words, when Knox Capture is launched, *any* app can trigger the camera scanner and receive barcode data in the form of keystrokes. This makes it easy to use Knox Capture for basic scanning purposes without any additional setup. When using the default scanning profile, IT admins can change the profile's scan engine settings and data processing rules, however they cannot change the default profile's apps and activities behavior

Scan data is only partially sent to business app. Overview When sending longer barcode data as keystrokes from Knox Capture to a business app, only part of the data can be seen in the business app. Pre-condition This article assumes that the following conditions are met in your Knox Capture scanning profile: 1. Continuous scanning is enabled. This setting is disabled by default. 2. Keystroke output is configured to send scan data as Key events. By default, this value is set to String. Cause When Keystroke data is configured to send as a key event (rather than a string), the processing time is increased. After an internal timer counts down to zero, Knox Capture assumes that all scanned data was delivered successfully to the target field in the business app, and switches the focus back to the scanner overlay. The remaining undelivered data is then sent to the scanner overlay instead of the business app. Resolution In the Knox Capture profile settings, navigate to Keystroke output > Set key event delay and extend the length of time before the foreground focus switches back to the scanner overlay. By default, the key event delay is set to 0 ms. The delay you set occurs between individual key events sent to the business app. For example, when sending scan data that's 10 characters long with a 50 ms key event delay, a 500 ms total delay can be observed.

Scanning profiles. Knox Capture acts as a wedge by translating barcode data into keystrokes that can be sent to a business application. But how does Knox Capture know what barcode types to scan, how to interpret scanned data, and which business applications to pass the data to? For Knox Capture, the *Scanning profile* defines the app's core behavior. A Scanning Profile is a configuration file that gets created or modified by an IT admin using the Knox Capture application. The profile defines how Knox Capture performs a barcode scan, and primarily consists of the following parameters: 1. Apps and activities - define which applications that can launch the Knox Capture scanner. 2. Scanner engine settings - specifying the barcode technologies (QR, Code 128, UPCA, etc.), scanning methods (single barcode, multi barcode), and camera behavior (enable flash, allow camera zoom). 3. Keystroke output rules - specifying how barcode data gets converted into keystrokes (append Tab or Enter character to each barcode, add prefix or suffix characters, convert output to hex characters, etc.) Default scanning profile Out-of-the-box, Knox Capture includes a default scanning profile that gets automatically associated with all apps on the device. In other words, when Knox Capture is launched, *any* app can trigger the camera scanner and receive barcode data in the form of keystrokes. This makes it easy to use Knox Capture for basic scanning purposes without any additional setup. When using the default scanning profile, IT admins can change the profile's scan engine settings and data processing rules, however they cannot change the default profile's apps and activities behavior. For example, an IT admin can modify the default profile to append a Tab key at the end of each barcode, but they cannot change which apps can trigger the scanner. Custom scanning profiles While the default scanning profile allows Knox Capture to be used right away without any configuration, IT admins may want to use a custom profile to better suit their needs. With a custom profile, IT admins control which apps and activities can trigger a barcode scan. Any apps that you don't select in the custom profile will follow the default behavior in that the barcode scanner is active for all apps not specified in the custom profile. Creating custom scanning profiles Custom profiles can be created by modifying the default profile settings, or by creating entirely new profiles altogether. 1. Tap the + button near the top of the app UI to open the profile creation options. 2. Select Create profile to start a profile from scratch, or select Duplicate existing profile to copy the settings from an existing (custom or default) profile. Alternatively, you can create a custom profile by clicking Create profile without clicking the + button. 3. Provide a profile name, then tap Done. The new profile appears in the profiles area below Defult scanning profile.

Configure keystroke output and data formatting. Knox Capture sends scanned data to business apps as keystrokes, imitating the way a user manually enters data using a keyboard. If you activate a KPE (Knox Platform for Enterprise) Premium license with a Galaxy S20 device in WP-C mode, you must set `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` to True in your EMM. Enabling this policy allows keystroke output to function as expected.

Overview. Get started with the basics by learning what Knox Capture is and how it works. What is Knox Capture? To help explain what Knox Capture does, it may be helpful to start with an understanding of what a *wedge* scanner is, and how it relates to the Knox Capture solution. In traditional hardware-based barcode scanning terminology, a wedge scanner is a physical device that attaches between a keyboard and a computer. The keyboard attaches to the scanner, and the scanner attaches to the computer. From the computer's perspective, the scanner behaves just like an additional keyboard. When the computer runs a software program (like an inventory spreadsheet app), and barcodes are read using the wedge scanner, data is sent from the scanner to the program in the form of keystrokes. From the program's point of view, data appears exactly as if someone had typed it manually using a keyboard. How Knox Capture works In a similar way, Knox Capture also acts as a wedge between a software program and keyboard. However, instead of being a physical scanning device, Knox Capture is a mobile solution built for compatible Android smartphones and tablets. Enterprise IT admins can either download the Knox Capture app from Google Play, or custom-build their own wedge scanner apps using the Knox Capture SDK (Software Development Kit). Once Knox Capture is installed and running on a device, it *wedges* between an application (for example, a business app used to track inventory) and the mobile device's on-screen keyboard. When an end-user launches their business app, they can simply tap an on-screen button or press a hardware button on their device to trigger a barcode scan using the device's camera. After the camera focuses on a barcode, Knox Capture translates the barcode data into keystrokes, which then get passed back to the business app for processing. From the business app's point of view, keystrokes coming from Knox Capture appear exactly as if a user had typed them from the device keyboard. Who can use Knox Capture? Knox Capture is designed for anyone who wants to turn their mobile device into a powerful barcode scanner. However, depending on whether it's being used by an admin or an end-user, its features vary significantly. #Admin mode (Default) When Knox Capture is downloaded from Google Play and installed on a compatible Android device - and a valid license key is activated - the app operates in its default Admin mode. This mode allows the device user - typically an enterprise IT admin - to utilize the full functionality of the app to primarily do the following: 1. Create scanning profiles that define which apps can launch the barcode scanner, which barcode types can be scanned (QR, Code 128, EAN8, etc.), and how scanned data is formatted (append Tab or Enter key, insert special characters before or after data, etc.). 2. Test scanning profiles to ensure that appropriate business apps can launch the scanner and receive data back as keystrokes. 3. Export profile settings as a configuration file, which can then be used by EMM/UEM administrators to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to end-user devices. #Managed mode After an IT admin uses their EMM/UEM to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to an end-user's device, the device launches the app in Managed mode. In Managed mode, Knox Capture functionality is greatly reduced. End-users can review their scanning profile settings and perform barcode scans using their business apps (as permitted by their scanning profile), however they can't make changes to their scanning profiles, export profile settings, or switch to Admin mode by activating a Knox Capture license. Admin mode is the default mode of operation for Knox Capture. The procedures described in this guide are targeted at an IT admin audience. Further reading #Getting started tutorials These tutorials provide a guided workflow for new admins and end-users. While they don't cover every setting or scenario when using Knox Capture, they do provide a good starting point for learning the app's basics",356

Manage licenses. Customers who download Knox Capture from Google Play and use it for the first time are automatically given a trial license that allows them to try the app and perform up to 100 free scans. After the free scan limit has been reached, a valid Knox Suite license is required for continued use. Get a Knox Suite license The first step towards getting a Knox Suite license is signing up for a Samsung Knox account if you haven't already done so. Refer to our detailed walkthrough of the account set up process for more information. Once you have an account, do the following: 1. Apply for access to Knox Suite. Refer to Apply for access to Knox Suite to learn more. 2. Once you sign in to the Knox Admin Portal, navigate to the Licenses page to generate your Knox Capture license. Refer to the Manage other licenses section of the Knox Admin Portal's how-to guide for a detailed walkthrough. 3. Once you generate your Knox Suite license, use the key to activate your Knox Capture license. Activate your Knox Capture license There are two ways to activate your Knox Capture license: For IT admins using Knox Capture, the license can be activated through the License menu in the app. To allow end-users to fully use Knox Capture app in managed mode, the license must be activated through your EMM. #Through the License menu There are two options for activating a license through the License menu. ##Option 1: Enter license key manually 1. On the home screen, tap the options button, then select License. 2. Under Enter Knox Capture license, tap the text field. 3. A popup appears prompting for your Knox Capture license key. After you enter the license key, tap Done. The license screen then confirms your license is active. Note that you cannot launch the menu again until your Knox Capture license expires, to prevent the license from being overwritten. ##Option 2: Enter license by scanning a QR code To use this method, you'll first need to have a valid Knox Suite license key converted into QR code format. Once you have a QR code generated: 1. On the home screen, tap the options button, then select License. 2. Under Enter Knox Capture license, tap the QR code button. A scanning window appears. 3. Aim the camera at the QR code, then tap Done to activate the license. Uninstalling the Knox Capture app automatically deactivates the license. If you install Knox Capture again, you must re-enter the license key in the License menu. #Through your EMM To activate a license through your EMM: 1. Open the application configuration dialog for Knox Capture in the EMM console. In a typical EMM console, the app configuration (or App Config) screen opens as a pop-up window or modal. 2. Paste the key within the license field 3. Save the configuration. View remaining scans If you are using the free version of Knox Capture, you can view the number of remaining scans directly on the License page. When 10 or fewer scans remain, the camera preview window notifies the user that the remaining scan count is low. Deactivate a license If a device is inactive for 180 days, its Knox Capture license assignment is automatically released. If Knox Capture records activity on the device after 180 days have elapsed, the server automatically handles reactivation. Knox Capture offers the following ways to deactivate your license: Using the Device Deactivation tool, Through your EMM, By uninstalling the Knox Capture app Performing a factory reset on a device does not automatically deactivate its Knox Capture license. #Using the Device Deactivation tool Like Knox Platform for Enterprise and Knox Suite license keys, Knox Capture license keys can be deactivated using the Device Deactivation tool in the Knox Admin Portal. Note that you need a list of device IMEIs to either deactivate or keep. For steps on how to access and use the Device Deactivation tool, see How to disassociate a device from a Knox license key",250
What are two ways to deactivate a Knox Capture license if it was activated through an EMM?,"To deactivate a Knox Capture license if it was activated through an EMM, you can send an uninstallation command for the Knox Capture app or edit the existing license field in the Knox Capture app configuration.","

The two ways to deactivate a Knox Capture license if it was activated through an EMM are:

1. Push an uninstallation command for the Knox Capture app from the EMM. Once the device receives the command, the Knox Capture app is removed and its license seat is unassigned.

- INTENT_OUTPUT_SCAN_SOURCE: Indicates the scan source (e.g. camera)
- INTENT_OUTPUT_SYMBLOGY_TYPE: Indicates the barcode symbology type 
- INTENT_OUTPUT_UNPROCESSED_STRING_DATA: Contains the unprocessed string data from the barcode
- INTENT_OUTPUT_UNPROCESSED_RAW_DATA: Contains the unprocessed raw byte data from the barcode

Use intent output. If your business app needs to obtain scanned data programmatically (for example, to process it further in-app), Knox Capture can pass the data within an Android intent object instead of through keystroke output. You can also enable intent output to work with keystroke output. For example, if you select Send via startActivity as your intent delivery method, Knox Capture first sends keystrokes to the foreground activity, then sends the intent to the new activity instance. To use Knox Capture's intent output feature: Business app developers must ensure the business app receives the intent, and, IT admins must configure Knox Capture's Intent output feature accordingly. The information in this section is divided into instructions for business app developers and instructions for Knox Capture admins. For business app developers #Edit the AndroidManifest.xml file For your business app to parse the scanned data, you need to set up Knox Capture to send it the correct intent output. To do so, edit AndroidManifest.xml to define the package name, intent action and category. Knox Capture offers three different methods for your app to receive an Android intent. Refer to Intent output settings for more details. The following is a snippet demonstrating the manifest information to edit. Ensure you replace any dummy strings with ones relevant to your app. ``` PackageName = applicationId ""com.test.smartscan"" AndroidManifest.xml ``` If you're using an activity to receive the intent: ``` ``` If you're using the foreground service to receive the intent: ``` ``` If you're using the broadcast receiver to receive the intent: ``` ``` Properly defining the intent filter information ensures that after each successful scan, Knox Capture delivers the intent to your business app through the chosen method. #What's included in the intent output After a successful scan, the configured intent triggers and is sent to the business app along with the following key information. ##Test mode status If Send via startActivity is selected as the intent delivery, test mode can be affected.

Knox Capture v1.5 release notes. Scanner overlay Starting with Knox Capture v1.5, a scanner overlay is available. This overlay appears as a scanner preview over business apps, and enables device users to immediately see scanned data entered into an app field. Functionally, the scanner overlay works much like the full-screen scanner. When the device user aims the camera at the barcode, Knox Capture then sends the scanned data to the business app depending on whether single scan or multi-scan mode is enabled, and how Barcode selection is configured. See Use the scanner overlay to learn more. Continuous scanning for single scan mode Previously, when device users scanned single barcodes, the camera preview turned on before each scan, then off again once the scan was completed. Now, in Single scan preferences, you can turn on Continuous scanning to scan back-to-back barcodes without relaunching the camera preview after every scan

. To learn more about this new feature, see Scanner overlay. #Inverse color barcode support This release adds a new Performance lab feature that allows users to scan inverse colored barcodes. This feature only works with Data Matrix and QR type barcodes in this release. To enable this option, go to the Knox Capture main screen, then tap the Options button (three dots), tap Performance lab, then enable Inverted color recognition. Enhancements Knox Capture v1.8 includes the following enhancements to existing features: #More intuitive user prompts when connecting USB device Previously, users would get a prompt even if Knox Capture wasn't running in the foreground. For example, a user might want to connect a USB keyboard for use in their business. When connecting the keyboard, they would see a prompt asking if they wanted to use the USB keyboard for scanning purposes, even though they may not be using Knox Capture at the time

Knox Capture v1.8 release notes. New features Knox Capture v1.8 introduces the following new features: #Continuous single scan A new Continuous scanning option appears on the Scan engine settings > Single scan preferences screen. When this option is toggled On, device users can scan several barcodes in sequence - and have each scan be registered as a single event - without having to press the camera trigger button between each scan. To learn more about the Continuous scanning feature, see Single scan preferences. #Scanner overlay In this release, device users have the option to view the camera preview window as an overlay on top of their business app. When the Scanner overlay feature is enabled and a scan is triggered, users will see a mini camera preview window on top of their existing business app screen.

For example, a user might want to connect a USB keyboard for use in their business. When connecting the keyboard, they would see a prompt asking if they wanted to use the USB keyboard for scanning purposes, even though they may not be using Knox Capture at the time. This release improves the prompt so that it only shows when Knox Capture is being used in the foreground. The device user must grant system permissions for connected devices in order for the prompt to display. If no permissions are granted, the prompt will not display on any screen. #Seamlessly switch between multiple paired devices in Output path If a user is paired with multiple devices in Knox Capture's Output path, they can now switch between each of their paired devices more easily. Previously, if a user had two paired devices in Output path, and Knox Capture was connected to _device A_, the user would first have to disconnect from _device A_ before connecting to _device B_. With this release, the user simply has to connect to _device B_. Knox Capture automatically disconnects from any previously paired devices. #Receive a notification when overlay is restricted by IT admin Some device users may experience an issue where they are unable to view the camera preview window after triggering a scan. This issue can be caused by a restriction set by the IT admin and the organization's UEM policy. Previously, if the restriction was set, the user would simply not be able to see the preview window. In this release, the user will now get a notification asking them to contact their IT admin for more information. To learn more about the restriction, see the Knox Capture Knowledge Base Article (KBA) related to this issue. Back to release notes",190

Describe an example use case for the search-and-find AR template. What problem does it help solve?,This AR template can help a retail worker locate a single box from a large wall of boxes in a warehouse. It analyzes each barcode in the camera preview window and overlays a match on the worker's screen for easy identification.," An example use case for the search-and-find AR template is that a retail worker may be asked to locate a single box from a large wall of boxes in a warehouse. Knox Capture AR helps solve the problem of locating a specific item when there are many similar items, by allowing the worker to scan a reference barcode first. Then when the worker points the camera at the wall of boxes, the AR overlay analyzes each barcode and highlights when it finds a match to the reference barcode. This makes it much easier for the worker to locate the specific box they need from among many similar boxes.",1,1,6,1.0,0.9997305274009705,1.0,0,6.678398370742798,". #Search-and-find templates This AR template provides an overlay to help users locate and isolate a single barcode when several similar barcodes are in the camera preview window. For example, a retail worker may be asked to locate a single box from a large wall of boxes in a warehouse. Using Knox Capture AR, the worker can start by scanning a reference barcode of the item they're searching for. After the reference barcode is scanned, the worker simply needs to point their camera at the wall of boxes in the warehouse. Knox Capture AR then analyzes each barcode in view, looking for a match. When a match is found, the AR overlay highlights the barcode, and additional product information is provided to the worker for review. #View-and-update templates This AR template provides an overlay to allow users to view product information and make real-time updates to a product database whenever a barcode is scanned

. #View-and-update templates This AR template provides an overlay to allow users to view product information and make real-time updates to a product database whenever a barcode is scanned. For example, a retail worker may want to know if there is enough inventory of a certain item before making a large-quantity transaction. Using Knox Capture AR, the worker can scan one of the items to bring up additional product information in the AR overlay. The worker can then see how many items are available in stock, and (after making the sale) immediately update their product database with a new stock count in real-time. See also , Refer to the Configure Knox Capture AR guide for instructions on creating Search-and-find and View-and-update AR templates as an IT admin. Refer to the Use Knox Capture AR guide for instructions on how to use AR templates to scan barcodes as an IT admin or end-user.

Configure AR. Refer to the following instructions for creating Knox Capture AR templates. Configure Search-and-find template To create an AR template that allows users to search for a reference barcode: 1. Tap the menu button (three vertical dots) next to the search icon on the Knox Capture home screen, then select Augmented reality > Configure AR. 2.

AR overview. The Knox Capture AR (Augmented Reality) is a feature that allows users to view important, business-critical information on the device screen when peforming a barcode scan. Normally, whenever a user launches the scanner, aims their camera at one or more barcodes, and captures the barcode data, Knox Capture simply passes the barcode information back to the business-app for review for the user to review. There is no way for the user to interact with any of the information until it reaches the business-app. To some organizations, scanning several barcodes and reviewing the data only _after_ it reaches the business-app can be inefficient, especially if the information isn't what they were looking for in the first place. This could lead to re-scans and additional worker overhead in order to capture the proper data. When a user triggers a barcode scan using Knox Capture AR, the camera preview window gets augmented with a customizable overlay that allows the user to view, analyze, and interact with the barcode data in real-time. For example, a retail worker using AR to scan an item could view information like the product's model number, sale price, or remaining inventory count, all from within the camera preview window, without ever having to open their business app to review the data. About AR templates Just like how scanning profiles define core Knox Capture behavior like which apps can trigger a scan, which barcodes are accepted, and what happens to data after it gets captured, AR templates also define the characteristics and behaviors of the Knox Capture AR feature. #Search-and-find templates This AR template provides an overlay to help users locate and isolate a single barcode when several similar barcodes are in the camera preview window. For example, a retail worker may be asked to locate a single box from a large wall of boxes in a warehouse. Using Knox Capture AR, the worker can start by scanning a reference barcode of the item they're searching for. After the reference barcode is scanned, the worker simply needs to point their camera at the wall of boxes in the warehouse. Knox Capture AR then analyzes each barcode in view, looking for a match. When a match is found, the AR overlay highlights the barcode, and additional product information is provided to the worker for review. #View-and-update templates This AR template provides an overlay to allow users to view product information and make real-time updates to a product database whenever a barcode is scanned. For example, a retail worker may want to know if there is enough inventory of a certain item before making a large-quantity transaction. Using Knox Capture AR, the worker can scan one of the items to bring up additional product information in the AR overlay. The worker can then see how many items are available in stock, and (after making the sale) immediately update their product database with a new stock count in real-time. See also , Refer to the Configure Knox Capture AR guide for instructions on creating Search-and-find and View-and-update AR templates as an IT admin. Refer to the Use Knox Capture AR guide for instructions on how to use AR templates to scan barcodes as an IT admin or end-user.

Out-of-range barcode still scanned successfully by Knox Capture. Overview For example, assuming you've set a symbol count range of 7 - 20 for Code 128 barcodes, the following situations may occur: Code ""1234567"" (length 7) can be successfully scanned. Code ""12345678"" (length 8) can be successfully scanned. Code ""123456"" (length 6) can't be successfully scanned. Code ""12345"" (length 5) can be successfully scanned. This is unexpected behavior. Code ""1234"" (length 4) can't be successfully scanned. Cause When setting the scan length, there's a difference between the number of digits or characters and the active symbol count. The correlation between characters and symbol counts depends on the encoding standard. For instance, Code 128 differs from Code 39. For Code 128, there are three different encoding schemes that can be mixed within a single Code 128 barcode to achieve the shortest possible code. Resolution Check which encoding standards your barcode data follows.

Keystroke output support in WP-C deployments In previous Knox Capture versions, if an IT admin activated a KPE Premium license with a WP-C deployment, remote injection was blocked in WP-C mode. As a workaround, `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` must be set to True to support keystroke output. With this release, keystroke output in WP-C deployments is supported regardless of whether `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` is set to True. Keystroke output support is not yet available for Galaxy S20 devices. You must use the aforementioned workaround to use keystroke output on Galaxy S20 devices. Option to disable default profile IT admins can now enable or disable the default profile. If you create profiles for several applications and don't want the default profile's behavior to override any configurations, set the default profile to Off. The default profile setting is available on the Knox Capture main page. You can change the configuration at any time, export and deploy it to end users in Managed mode. If a profile is not active for an app or foreground activity and the end user attempts to scan a barcode, an error message is shown stating that the application does not support Knox Capture scanning. This setting cannot be changed in Managed mode. New floating button scan trigger !Hardware scan trigger setting !Hardware scan trigger setting A floating scan button is now available that launches the Knox Capture camera for scanning. By default, the scan button appears in the bottom right corner of the device's screen. Users can move it around the screen, and it remains in the last known position until it's toggled off. The scan button can be used in both Admin and Managed modes. See Set camera trigger for more information on the various available triggers. License activation menu for unmanaged devices Previously, Knox Capture licenses could only be used by organizations pushing them through an MDM.

Scanning profiles. Knox Capture acts as a wedge by translating barcode data into keystrokes that can be sent to a business application. But how does Knox Capture know what barcode types to scan, how to interpret scanned data, and which business applications to pass the data to? For Knox Capture, the *Scanning profile* defines the app's core behavior. A Scanning Profile is a configuration file that gets created or modified by an IT admin using the Knox Capture application. The profile defines how Knox Capture performs a barcode scan, and primarily consists of the following parameters: 1. Apps and activities - define which applications that can launch the Knox Capture scanner. 2. Scanner engine settings - specifying the barcode technologies (QR, Code 128, UPCA, etc.), scanning methods (single barcode, multi barcode), and camera behavior (enable flash, allow camera zoom). 3

Knox Capture v1.5 release notes. Scanner overlay Starting with Knox Capture v1.5, a scanner overlay is available. This overlay appears as a scanner preview over business apps, and enables device users to immediately see scanned data entered into an app field. Functionally, the scanner overlay works much like the full-screen scanner. When the device user aims the camera at the barcode, Knox Capture then sends the scanned data to the business app depending on whether single scan or multi-scan mode is enabled, and how Barcode selection is configured. See Use the scanner overlay to learn more. Continuous scanning for single scan mode Previously, when device users scanned single barcodes, the camera preview turned on before each scan, then off again once the scan was completed. Now, in Single scan preferences, you can turn on Continuous scanning to scan back-to-back barcodes without relaunching the camera preview after every scan. This feature maximizes worker efficiency when used with a Bluetooth wedge or the scanner overlay. Improvements to configuration behavior after profile mode change With this release, if a Knox Capture profile is pushed to a device in Admin mode through a UEM, the device enters Managed mode and removes any configurations previously applied in Admin mode. For example, consider a device user who's conducting practice scans in Admin mode. Upon receiving a profile configuration, a notification on the device confirms that the configuration updated, and Knox Capture automatically turns off test mode and clears the test results. PDF417 barcode support for default profiles Starting with Knox Capture v1.5, default profiles now include the PDF417 barcode type. The current barcode symbologies enabled in the default profile are: Code 128, QR, Code 39, EAN8, EAN13/UPCA, UPCE, Interleaved 2 of 5, Data Matrix, PDF417 Back to release notes",493

. 3. Export profile settings as a configuration file, which can then be used by EMM/UEM administrators to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to end-user devices. #Managed mode After an IT admin uses their EMM/UEM to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to an end-user's device, the device launches the app in Managed mode. In Managed mode, Knox Capture functionality is greatly reduced. End-users can review their scanning profile settings and perform barcode scans using their business apps (as permitted by their scanning profile), however they can't make changes to their scanning profiles, export profile settings, or switch to Admin mode by activating a Knox Capture license. Admin mode is the default mode of operation for Knox Capture. The procedures described in this guide are targeted at an IT admin audience.

Knox Capture v1.8 release notes. New features Knox Capture v1.8 introduces the following new features: #Continuous single scan A new Continuous scanning option appears on the Scan engine settings > Single scan preferences screen. When this option is toggled On, device users can scan several barcodes in sequence - and have each scan be registered as a single event - without having to press the camera trigger button between each scan. To learn more about the Continuous scanning feature, see Single scan preferences. #Scanner overlay In this release, device users have the option to view the camera preview window as an overlay on top of their business app. When the Scanner overlay feature is enabled and a scan is triggered, users will see a mini camera preview window on top of their existing business app screen. To learn more about this new feature, see Scanner overlay. #Inverse color barcode support This release adds a new Performance lab feature that allows users to scan inverse colored barcodes. This feature only works with Data Matrix and QR type barcodes in this release. To enable this option, go to the Knox Capture main screen, then tap the Options button (three dots), tap Performance lab, then enable Inverted color recognition. Enhancements Knox Capture v1.8 includes the following enhancements to existing features: #More intuitive user prompts when connecting USB device Previously, users would get a prompt even if Knox Capture wasn't running in the foreground. For example, a user might want to connect a USB keyboard for use in their business. When connecting the keyboard, they would see a prompt asking if they wanted to use the USB keyboard for scanning purposes, even though they may not be using Knox Capture at the time. This release improves the prompt so that it only shows when Knox Capture is being used in the foreground. The device user must grant system permissions for connected devices in order for the prompt to display. If no permissions are granted, the prompt will not display on any screen. #Seamlessly switch between multiple paired devices in Output path If a user is paired with multiple devices in Knox Capture's Output path, they can now switch between each of their paired devices more easily. Previously, if a user had two paired devices in Output path, and Knox Capture was connected to _device A_, the user would first have to disconnect from _device A_ before connecting to _device B_. With this release, the user simply has to connect to _device B_. Knox Capture automatically disconnects from any previously paired devices. #Receive a notification when overlay is restricted by IT admin Some device users may experience an issue where they are unable to view the camera preview window after triggering a scan. This issue can be caused by a restriction set by the IT admin and the organization's UEM policy. Previously, if the restriction was set, the user would simply not be able to see the preview window.

How can managed mode be automatically applied to enterprise devices?,"To automatically apply managed mode to enterprise devices, Knox Capture must be configured and deployed through an EMM (Enterprise Mobility Management) console."," To automatically apply managed mode to enterprise devices:

Managed mode is automatically applied when Knox Capture is configured and deployed through an EMM (enterprise mobility management) console. Specifically, the IT admin exports the profile settings as a configuration file. Then EMM/UEM (unified endpoint management) administrators deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to end-user devices using that configuration file. This causes the devices to launch Knox Capture in managed mode.",1,1,6,1.0,0.9999219179153442,1.0,0,7.2169365882873535,"How do I enforce Managed mode on enterprise devices . Managed mode is automatically applied when Knox Capture is configured and deployed through an EMM console. For details on deploying the app in Managed mode, see Deployment.

. 3. Export profile settings as a configuration file, which can then be used by EMM/UEM administrators to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to end-user devices. #Managed mode After an IT admin uses their EMM/UEM to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to an end-user's device, the device launches the app in Managed mode. In Managed mode, Knox Capture functionality is greatly reduced. End-users can review their scanning profile settings and perform barcode scans using their business apps (as permitted by their scanning profile), however they can't make changes to their scanning profiles, export profile settings, or switch to Admin mode by activating a Knox Capture license. Admin mode is the default mode of operation for Knox Capture. The procedures described in this guide are targeted at an IT admin audience. Further reading #Getting started tutorials These tutorials provide a guided workflow for new admins and end-users

. Once the IT admin has configured the profile, they push it to enterprise devices through their EMM. Device users can then start using the business app to scan barcodes.

. Now, in Single scan preferences, you can turn on Continuous scanning to scan back-to-back barcodes without relaunching the camera preview after every scan. This feature maximizes worker efficiency when used with a Bluetooth wedge or the scanner overlay. Improvements to configuration behavior after profile mode change With this release, if a Knox Capture profile is pushed to a device in Admin mode through a UEM, the device enters Managed mode and removes any configurations previously applied in Admin mode. For example, consider a device user who's conducting practice scans in Admin mode. Upon receiving a profile configuration, a notification on the device confirms that the configuration updated, and Knox Capture automatically turns off test mode and clears the test results. PDF417 barcode support for default profiles Starting with Knox Capture v1.5, default profiles now include the PDF417 barcode type

. 3. Assign the app to a group or organization and launch the app configuration dialog. In most consoles, the app configuration (or App Config) dialog opens as a pop-up window or modal. 4. Activate your license in the EMM. 5. Copy and paste the text of the exported Knox Capture configuration into the provided configuration field. 6. Save the updated settings and deploy. If you do not add a configuration for Knox Capture in Managed Google Play when updating a license key, the app operates according to its _previous_ configuration. For example, a device with an existing scan configuration will continue to operate in Managed mode after updating the license key. However, a new device without an existing configuration will operate in Admin mode. To ensure _all_ devices operate in Managed mode, prepare and include the configuration each time you add or modify the app within the EMM console

What are some common reasons why barcode data may not output correctly to a business app?,Most barcode capture issues begin with minor errors in the keystroke output and scan engine settings.," Barcode data may not output correctly to a business app for several common reasons, according to the given context:

1. Minor errors in the keystroke output and scan engine settings. The article suggests trying test mode to verify configurations.

2. If keystroke data is configured to send as key events rather than a string, the processing time is increased. This can cause partially cut off barcode output if the internal timer counts down before all data is delivered. Increasing the key event delay setting may help. 

3. For longer barcode data, continuous scanning mode may cause only part of the data to reach the business app before focus switches back to the scanner overlay. The remaining undelivered data is then sent to the overlay instead.",1,1,6,1.0,0.9733027219772339,1.0,0,32.42311453819275,"Barcode capture not working for business app. Overview You may encounter situations where barcode data is not outputting correctly to your business app. Why isn't barcode capture working for my business app?

Scan data is only partially sent to business app. Overview When sending longer barcode data as keystrokes from Knox Capture to a business app, only part of the data can be seen in the business app. Pre-condition This article assumes that the following conditions are met in your Knox Capture scanning profile: 1. Continuous scanning is enabled. This setting is disabled by default. 2. Keystroke output is configured to send scan data as Key events. By default, this value is set to String. Cause When Keystroke data is configured to send as a key event (rather than a string), the processing time is increased. After an internal timer counts down to zero, Knox Capture assumes that all scanned data was delivered successfully to the target field in the business app, and switches the focus back to the scanner overlay. The remaining undelivered data is then sent to the scanner overlay instead of the business app

AR overview. The Knox Capture AR (Augmented Reality) is a feature that allows users to view important, business-critical information on the device screen when peforming a barcode scan. Normally, whenever a user launches the scanner, aims their camera at one or more barcodes, and captures the barcode data, Knox Capture simply passes the barcode information back to the business-app for review for the user to review. There is no way for the user to interact with any of the information until it reaches the business-app. To some organizations, scanning several barcodes and reviewing the data only _after_ it reaches the business-app can be inefficient, especially if the information isn't what they were looking for in the first place. This could lead to re-scans and additional worker overhead in order to capture the proper data

. None &mdash; Sends no output for ASCII printable characters. String Key event delay Sets the delay in milliseconds that Knox Capture will wait before sending a key event like Tab. Key events transmit slower than string data, which can cause synchronization problems. If your barcode output is partially cut off, try increasing the key event delay to a higher value. [0, Int32 max value] 0 Basic data formatting Refer to the following basic data formatting information to create rules to add prefixes, suffixes, and append Tab or Enter characters to scanned barcode data before output. If appending a Tab or Enter key to the data output, you must also select an output option in the Send Tab as or Sent Enter as settings above. Setting , Description , Default - , - , - Prefix to data , Prepends a string of characters to the beginning of the scanned data. None Suffix to data , Appends a string of characters to the end of the scanned data

Keystroke output data sent to browser or web app instead of business app. Overview Certain company-owned devices with a work profile might encounter an issue where barcode data sent through keystroke output is delivered to a browser or web app instead of the business app. Cause With recent improvements to company-owned devices with a work profile, a change was made to the way web apps - apps delivered through the browser instead of natively on Android - handle text view focus after scanning. On devices running Android 10 and lower, the text view is already in focus when scanned data returns to the business app. This focus behavior is no longer required with company-owned devices with a work profile running Android 11 and higher. Resolution To handle this change, you must enable the Allow remote control policy in your EMM to allow Knox Capture to restore focus to the text view. You only need to enable this policy if you've activated a Knox Platform for Enterprise Premium license.

Configure keystroke output and data formatting. Knox Capture sends scanned data to business apps as keystrokes, imitating the way a user manually enters data using a keyboard. If you activate a KPE (Knox Platform for Enterprise) Premium license with a Galaxy S20 device in WP-C mode, you must set `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` to True in your EMM. Enabling this policy allows keystroke output to function as expected. Keystroke output Refer to the following settings to modify scanned data and format its output: Setting Description Options Default Send Enter character as Sets the output format for all existing and appended Enters Key event &mdash; Sends Enter as a key event. String &mdash; Sends Enter as ASCII Line Feed 0x0A. Both String and Key event &mdash; Sends Enter as ASCII Line Feed 0x0A and key event. None &mdash; Sends no output for Enter.

Scanner engine settings - specifying the barcode technologies (QR, Code 128, UPCA, etc.), scanning methods (single barcode, multi barcode), and camera behavior (enable flash, allow camera zoom). 3. Keystroke output rules - specifying how barcode data gets converted into keystrokes (append Tab or Enter character to each barcode, add prefix or suffix characters, convert output to hex characters, etc.) Default scanning profile Out-of-the-box, Knox Capture includes a default scanning profile that gets automatically associated with all apps on the device. In other words, when Knox Capture is launched, *any* app can trigger the camera scanner and receive barcode data in the form of keystrokes. This makes it easy to use Knox Capture for basic scanning purposes without any additional setup. When using the default scanning profile, IT admins can change the profile's scan engine settings and data processing rules, however they cannot change the default profile's apps and activities behavior",1178

Use scanner overlay. The Scanner overlay feature lets device users view the camera preview window and the business app screen concurrently. When the user triggers a barcode scan, a mini camera preview is shown over the business app screen as a picture-in-picture (PiP) window, allowing users to use the scanner and view their app's data at the same time. Functionally, the Scanner overlay behaves just like the normal scanner. When the device user aims the camera at the barcode, Knox Capture sends the scanned data to the business app depending on how the scan engine settings are configured. Enable the Scanner overlay The Scanner overlay can be enabled in both Admin and Managed modes. To enable this feature, go to the Knox Capture home screen, tap the Options button (three dots), tap Scanner overlay, then toggle the feature On. When you launch the scanner overlay for the first time, an on-screen tutorial explains how to reposition and resize the overlay. By default, the overlay appears at the top of the screen. Any size or position adjustments you make to it are saved for future scanning sessions. Tap the X in the top-right corner to close the Scanner overlay.

Knox Capture v1.5 release notes. Scanner overlay Starting with Knox Capture v1.5, a scanner overlay is available. This overlay appears as a scanner preview over business apps, and enables device users to immediately see scanned data entered into an app field. Functionally, the scanner overlay works much like the full-screen scanner. When the device user aims the camera at the barcode, Knox Capture then sends the scanned data to the business app depending on whether single scan or multi-scan mode is enabled, and how Barcode selection is configured. See Use the scanner overlay to learn more. Continuous scanning for single scan mode Previously, when device users scanned single barcodes, the camera preview turned on before each scan, then off again once the scan was completed. Now, in Single scan preferences, you can turn on Continuous scanning to scan back-to-back barcodes without relaunching the camera preview after every scan

Knox Capture v1.7 release notes. New features #Launch of Samsung Knox Capture The most significant addition to Knox Capture v1.7 is the launch of a brand new, Samsung-developed scan engine that provides the same great feature-set as the Scandit engine, while also laying the foundations for Samsung to deliver exciting, industry-leading features to our customers in future releases. New customers will see an option to select their scan engine preference - either Knox Capture or Knox Capture: Scandit Edition - when launching the app for the first time and accepting the Knox Capture partner agreements. New customers can test the features of Knox Capture, and perform up to 100 free scans during their trial period, after which a valid Knox Suite license is required for commercial use. See Manage Knox Capture licenses to learn more about the new Knox Suite licensing requirements. #Knox Capture SDK This release introduces a brand new Knox Capture SDK to allow Android app developers to create their own barcode scanning applications. To learn more about our Knox Capture SDK, please visit our developer documentation site #Knox Capture AR (Augmented Reality) Version 1.7 of Knox Capture introduces a new AR (augmented reality) feature that displays an overlay on the device screen whenever one or more barcodes are scanned. IT admins can create AR templates to customize the information that displays on the overlay, as well as the overlay behavior. To get started with this exciting new feature, take a look at our Knox Capture AR guide for more information. #Low light scanning notification When using the camera to scan a barcode in low light conditions, a notification now displays in the capture preview window to suggest that the user enable their camera flashlight for better scanning results. This notification is enabled by default, but can be turned off by going to Knox Capture settings > Performance labs > Scanner toast notification. #Vibrate-notification after successful scan IT admins can now configure Knox Capture to vibrate the device after each successful barcode scan. This behavior is disabled by default, but can be enabled by going to a profile's Scan engine settings > Vibrate after scan. Enhancements #Output path accurately displays Paired devices list For customers who use their device as a Bluetooth wedge scanner to connect to a PC or host machine, Knox Capture now displays the Paired devices list only when the Use Bluetooth wedge slider is enabled. Previously, if a Bluetooth device was paired and the slider was in the OFF position, the Paired devices list would still show a list of disconnected devices. Now, the list only displays paired devices (connected or disconnected) if the slider is in the ON position. Known issues #Possible low barcode detection rate in certain glare or tiny conditions Testers have reported that Knox Capture can have difficulties detecting all barcodes under extreme glare conditions. It is recommended that users attempt to block or cover any glare on the barcodes before scanning. For customers who use Code 93 and Code 128 barcodes specifically, Knox Capture may have difficulties scanning barcodes that are too small.

Out-of-range barcode still scanned successfully by Knox Capture. Overview For example, assuming you've set a symbol count range of 7 - 20 for Code 128 barcodes, the following situations may occur: Code ""1234567"" (length 7) can be successfully scanned. Code ""12345678"" (length 8) can be successfully scanned. Code ""123456"" (length 6) can't be successfully scanned. Code ""12345"" (length 5) can be successfully scanned. This is unexpected behavior. Code ""1234"" (length 4) can't be successfully scanned. Cause When setting the scan length, there's a difference between the number of digits or characters and the active symbol count. The correlation between characters and symbol counts depends on the encoding standard. For instance, Code 128 differs from Code 39. For Code 128, there are three different encoding schemes that can be mixed within a single Code 128 barcode to achieve the shortest possible code. Resolution Check which encoding standards your barcode data follows.

Cannot output scanned barcode data to HTML fields in Chromium-based web browsers.

Activate your license in the EMM. 5. Copy and paste the text of the exported Knox Capture configuration into the provided configuration field. 6. Save the updated settings and deploy. If you do not add a configuration for Knox Capture in Managed Google Play when updating a license key, the app operates according to its _previous_ configuration. For example, a device with an existing scan configuration will continue to operate in Managed mode after updating the license key. However, a new device without an existing configuration will operate in Admin mode. To ensure _all_ devices operate in Managed mode, prepare and include the configuration each time you add or modify the app within the EMM console

How do I enforce Managed mode on enterprise devices . Managed mode is automatically applied when Knox Capture is configured and deployed through an EMM console. For details on deploying the app in Managed mode, see Deployment.",409

Get started with the basics by learning what Knox Capture is and how it works. What is Knox Capture? To help explain what Knox Capture does, it may be helpful to start with an understanding of what a *wedge* scanner is, and how it relates to the Knox Capture solution. In traditional hardware-based barcode scanning terminology, a wedge scanner is a physical device that attaches between a keyboard and a computer. The keyboard attaches to the scanner, and the scanner attaches to the computer. From the computer's perspective, the scanner behaves just like an additional keyboard. When the computer runs a software program (like an inventory spreadsheet app), and barcodes are read using the wedge scanner, data is sent from the scanner to the program in the form of keystrokes. From the program's point of view, data appears exactly as if someone had typed it manually using a keyboard. How Knox Capture works In a similar way, Knox Capture also acts as a wedge between a software program and keyboard

. From the program's point of view, data appears exactly as if someone had typed it manually using a keyboard. How Knox Capture works In a similar way, Knox Capture also acts as a wedge between a software program and keyboard. However, instead of being a physical scanning device, Knox Capture is a mobile solution built for compatible Android smartphones and tablets. Enterprise IT admins can either download the Knox Capture app from Google Play, or custom-build their own wedge scanner apps using the Knox Capture SDK (Software Development Kit). Once Knox Capture is installed and running on a device, it *wedges* between an application (for example, a business app used to track inventory) and the mobile device's on-screen keyboard. When an end-user launches their business app, they can simply tap an on-screen button or press a hardware button on their device to trigger a barcode scan using the device's camera

Why is Knox Capture called a wedge? . A wedge barcode scanner is a physical device that attaches to a keyboard or a computer. It reads barcode data and translates it to a string that is then input into the system, as if a user had manually typed the string using the keyboard. In the same way, Knox Capture acts as middleware that reads barcode data captured by the XCover Pro device, translates it into a string, formats the string, and then sends it to a third-party business app that understands the resulting data. Knox Capture takes care of integrating with your business app, so that you don't have to build barcode scanning logic into your business app using a software development kit (SDK). So how does Knox Capture know which barcodes to read, how to format the data, and which business app to send the data to? The IT admin defines those details in a profile in Knox Capture. Once the IT admin has configured the profile, they push it to enterprise devices through their EMM. Device users can then start using the business app to scan barcodes.

Configure keystroke output and data formatting. Knox Capture sends scanned data to business apps as keystrokes, imitating the way a user manually enters data using a keyboard. If you activate a KPE (Knox Platform for Enterprise) Premium license with a Galaxy S20 device in WP-C mode, you must set `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` to True in your EMM. Enabling this policy allows keystroke output to function as expected. Keystroke output Refer to the following settings to modify scanned data and format its output: Setting Description Options Default Send Enter character as Sets the output format for all existing and appended Enters Key event &mdash; Sends Enter as a key event. String &mdash; Sends Enter as ASCII Line Feed 0x0A. Both String and Key event &mdash; Sends Enter as ASCII Line Feed 0x0A and key event. None &mdash; Sends no output for Enter. None Send Tab character as Sets the output format for all existing and appended Tabs Key event &mdash; Sends Tab as a key event

Scan data is only partially sent to business app. Overview When sending longer barcode data as keystrokes from Knox Capture to a business app, only part of the data can be seen in the business app. Pre-condition This article assumes that the following conditions are met in your Knox Capture scanning profile: 1. Continuous scanning is enabled. This setting is disabled by default. 2. Keystroke output is configured to send scan data as Key events. By default, this value is set to String. Cause When Keystroke data is configured to send as a key event (rather than a string), the processing time is increased. After an internal timer counts down to zero, Knox Capture assumes that all scanned data was delivered successfully to the target field in the business app, and switches the focus back to the scanner overlay. The remaining undelivered data is then sent to the scanner overlay instead of the business app",478
What feature of Knox Capture allows business apps to process barcode data as if a user had typed the data from the device's keyboard?,"Knox Capture translates the barcode data into keystrokes, which then get passed back to the business app for processing."," Skip the preamble and go straight to the relevant context and answer.

When barcode data is captured, Knox Capture translates it into keystrokes which get passed to the business app, making it appear as if the data was manually typed on the keyboard.",1,1,6,1.0,0.9996819496154785,1.0,0,10.122700214385986,". When an end-user launches their business app, they can simply tap an on-screen button or press a hardware button on their device to trigger a barcode scan using the device's camera. After the camera focuses on a barcode, Knox Capture translates the barcode data into keystrokes, which then get passed back to the business app for processing. From the business app's point of view, keystrokes coming from Knox Capture appear exactly as if a user had typed them from the device keyboard. Who can use Knox Capture? Knox Capture is designed for anyone who wants to turn their mobile device into a powerful barcode scanner. However, depending on whether it's being used by an admin or an end-user, its features vary significantly. #Admin mode (Default) When Knox Capture is downloaded from Google Play and installed on a compatible Android device - and a valid license key is activated - the app operates in its default Admin mode

. From the program's point of view, data appears exactly as if someone had typed it manually using a keyboard. How Knox Capture works In a similar way, Knox Capture also acts as a wedge between a software program and keyboard. However, instead of being a physical scanning device, Knox Capture is a mobile solution built for compatible Android smartphones and tablets. Enterprise IT admins can either download the Knox Capture app from Google Play, or custom-build their own wedge scanner apps using the Knox Capture SDK (Software Development Kit). Once Knox Capture is installed and running on a device, it *wedges* between an application (for example, a business app used to track inventory) and the mobile device's on-screen keyboard. When an end-user launches their business app, they can simply tap an on-screen button or press a hardware button on their device to trigger a barcode scan using the device's camera

Overview. Get started with the basics by learning what Knox Capture is and how it works. What is Knox Capture? To help explain what Knox Capture does, it may be helpful to start with an understanding of what a *wedge* scanner is, and how it relates to the Knox Capture solution. In traditional hardware-based barcode scanning terminology, a wedge scanner is a physical device that attaches between a keyboard and a computer. The keyboard attaches to the scanner, and the scanner attaches to the computer. From the computer's perspective, the scanner behaves just like an additional keyboard. When the computer runs a software program (like an inventory spreadsheet app), and barcodes are read using the wedge scanner, data is sent from the scanner to the program in the form of keystrokes. From the program's point of view, data appears exactly as if someone had typed it manually using a keyboard. How Knox Capture works In a similar way, Knox Capture also acts as a wedge between a software program and keyboard

Scan data is only partially sent to business app. Overview When sending longer barcode data as keystrokes from Knox Capture to a business app, only part of the data can be seen in the business app. Pre-condition This article assumes that the following conditions are met in your Knox Capture scanning profile: 1. Continuous scanning is enabled. This setting is disabled by default. 2. Keystroke output is configured to send scan data as Key events. By default, this value is set to String. Cause When Keystroke data is configured to send as a key event (rather than a string), the processing time is increased. After an internal timer counts down to zero, Knox Capture assumes that all scanned data was delivered successfully to the target field in the business app, and switches the focus back to the scanner overlay. The remaining undelivered data is then sent to the scanner overlay instead of the business app

. This could lead to re-scans and additional worker overhead in order to capture the proper data. When a user triggers a barcode scan using Knox Capture AR, the camera preview window gets augmented with a customizable overlay that allows the user to view, analyze, and interact with the barcode data in real-time. For example, a retail worker using AR to scan an item could view information like the product's model number, sale price, or remaining inventory count, all from within the camera preview window, without ever having to open their business app to review the data. About AR templates Just like how scanning profiles define core Knox Capture behavior like which apps can trigger a scan, which barcodes are accepted, and what happens to data after it gets captured, AR templates also define the characteristics and behaviors of the Knox Capture AR feature

. 2. Scanner engine settings - specifying the barcode technologies (QR, Code 128, UPCA, etc.), scanning methods (single barcode, multi barcode), and camera behavior (enable flash, allow camera zoom). 3. Keystroke output rules - specifying how barcode data gets converted into keystrokes (append Tab or Enter character to each barcode, add prefix or suffix characters, convert output to hex characters, etc.) Default scanning profile Out-of-the-box, Knox Capture includes a default scanning profile that gets automatically associated with all apps on the device. In other words, when Knox Capture is launched, *any* app can trigger the camera scanner and receive barcode data in the form of keystrokes. This makes it easy to use Knox Capture for basic scanning purposes without any additional setup. When using the default scanning profile, IT admins can change the profile's scan engine settings and data processing rules, however they cannot change the default profile's apps and activities behavior",1101
What are the three primary functions available in Knox Capture's default Admin mode?,"When Knox Capture is installed on a compatible Android device and a valid license key is activated, the app operates in its default Admin mode. This mode allows the device user to do the following:
1. Create scanning profiles (define which apps can launch the barcode scanner, which barcode types can be scanned, and how scanned data is formatted).
2. Test scanning profiles (to ensure that appropriate business apps can launch the scanner and receive data back as keystrokes).
3. Export profile settings as a configuration file (which can then be deployed by EMM/UEM administrators on end-user devices)."," Knox Capture's default Admin mode primarily allows device users to:

Scanning profiles. Knox Capture acts as a wedge by translating barcode data into keystrokes that can be sent to a business application. But how does Knox Capture know what barcode types to scan, how to interpret scanned data, and which business applications to pass the data to? For Knox Capture, the *Scanning profile* defines the app's core behavior. A Scanning Profile is a configuration file that gets created or modified by an IT admin using the Knox Capture application. The profile defines how Knox Capture performs a barcode scan, and primarily consists of the following parameters: 1. Apps and activities - define which applications that can launch the Knox Capture scanner. 2. Scanner engine settings - specifying the barcode technologies (QR, Code 128, UPCA, etc.), scanning methods (single barcode, multi barcode), and camera behavior (enable flash, allow camera zoom). 3.

End-user get started. This tutorial guides an end-user through the Knox Capture application and explains how to launch the barcode scanner from an app, review a scanning profile configuration, and change camera scan triggers. Step 1: Get familiar with the Knox Capture interface The first time Knox Capture is launched, a prompt displays Knox Capture the Privacy Policy and EULA terms. After reviewing the terms, tap Agree to move to the home screen. On the home screen, you can change the Camera scan triggers options. This option allows users of rugged devices like the XCover Pro to choose which hardware key triggers the scanner. Note that the on-screen keyboard always displays the Knox Capture button, provided that you're using the default Samsung keyboard. Tap the options button to view the scanning configuration details, access support, and view data about the app. To view the current scanning configuration: 1. Tap View current configuration in the options menu. 2. On the Current configuration page, tap a profile name in the list to review its details. Applications - A list of device applications managed by the profile. Tap the app name to see which of the app's Android activities belong to the current profile. Scanner type - The IT admin-configured scan engine settings such as barcode types, flashlight settings, camera zoom levels, and more. Keystroke output - The rules configured to process and format scanned barcode data before it gets sent to an app as keystrokes. Step 2: Launch a device app Before scanning, first open an app and tap an input field, like the search input field, so Knox Capture knows where to send the scanned data. In the following example, the Samsung Internet app is used: 1. Launch the app. 2. Tap an input field in the app. In the following example, tap the Google search input field. Step 3: Trigger the scanner Next, either press the hardware key set up as your camera scanner trigger (if applicable), or tap the Knox Capture button on the keyboard. The Knox Capture button is only visible if Samsung Keyboard is selected as the default keyboard. Step 4: Scan a barcode Once the camera is triggered, point it at the following sample barcode: After focusing, Knox Capture automatically records and processes the captured data. Step 5: View the scanned data After processing the captured barcode data, Knox Capture sends it back to the app that triggered scanning. In this example, the Google search input field displays the barcode information: If the current configuration includes keystroke output rules, then those rules would apply to the barcode data. For example, if the IT admin created a rule to append an Enter key event after each scan, then this would emulate a user tapping Enter on their keyboard. In this example, it would trigger a Google search result for the characters ""ABC-1234"" Summary You are now familiar with the Knox Capture interface and can trigger and scan barcodes with a simple key press. You should also be able to select the camera scanning trigger and view the Knox Capture configuration set by the IT admin.

What are the two settings you can configure that will delay sending of key events like Tab from Knox Capture?,Key event delay: Sets the delay in milliseconds that Knox Capture will wait before sending a key event like Tab.," The two settings you can configure that will delay sending of key events like Tab from Knox Capture are:

1. Key event delay: This setting, found under Keystroke output, sets the delay in milliseconds that Knox Capture will wait before sending a key event like Tab. 

2. Set key event delay: This is the resolution suggested to extend the length of time before the foreground focus switches back to the scanner overlay, allowing more time for key events to be sent to the business app.",1,1,6,1.0,0.9999275207519531,1.0,0,4.7617878913879395,". None &mdash; Sends no output for ASCII printable characters. String Key event delay Sets the delay in milliseconds that Knox Capture will wait before sending a key event like Tab. Key events transmit slower than string data, which can cause synchronization problems. If your barcode output is partially cut off, try increasing the key event delay to a higher value. [0, Int32 max value] 0 Basic data formatting Refer to the following basic data formatting information to create rules to add prefixes, suffixes, and append Tab or Enter characters to scanned barcode data before output. If appending a Tab or Enter key to the data output, you must also select an output option in the Send Tab as or Sent Enter as settings above. Setting , Description , Default - , - , - Prefix to data , Prepends a string of characters to the beginning of the scanned data. None Suffix to data , Appends a string of characters to the end of the scanned data

Scan data is only partially sent to business app. Overview When sending longer barcode data as keystrokes from Knox Capture to a business app, only part of the data can be seen in the business app. Pre-condition This article assumes that the following conditions are met in your Knox Capture scanning profile: 1. Continuous scanning is enabled. This setting is disabled by default. 2. Keystroke output is configured to send scan data as Key events. By default, this value is set to String. Cause When Keystroke data is configured to send as a key event (rather than a string), the processing time is increased. After an internal timer counts down to zero, Knox Capture assumes that all scanned data was delivered successfully to the target field in the business app, and switches the focus back to the scanner overlay. The remaining undelivered data is then sent to the scanner overlay instead of the business app. Resolution In the Knox Capture profile settings, navigate to Keystroke output > Set key event delay and extend the length of time before the foreground focus switches back to the scanner overlay. By default, the key event delay is set to 0 ms. The delay you set occurs between individual key events sent to the business app. For example, when sending scan data that's 10 characters long with a 50 ms key event delay, a 500 ms total delay can be observed.

What feature allows you to view and edit product details such as stock count in an augmented reality overlay?,The augmented reality (AR) demo mode feature allows users to view and edit product details such as stock count in an augmented reality overlay.," Based on the context, the feature that allows you to view and edit product details like stock count in an augmented reality overlay is the View-and-update AR template. Specifically:

The View-and-update AR template provides an overlay that allows users to view product information and make real-time updates to a product database whenever a barcode is scanned. For example, a retail worker can scan an item to bring up additional details like stock count in the AR overlay. The worker can then update the stock count in real-time by tapping the edit icon next to the field in the overlay.",1,2,6,0.5,0.9998356103897095,1.0,0,9.666842222213745,". #View-and-update templates This AR template provides an overlay to allow users to view product information and make real-time updates to a product database whenever a barcode is scanned. For example, a retail worker may want to know if there is enough inventory of a certain item before making a large-quantity transaction. Using Knox Capture AR, the worker can scan one of the items to bring up additional product information in the AR overlay. The worker can then see how many items are available in stock, and (after making the sale) immediately update their product database with a new stock count in real-time.

Out-of-range barcode still scanned successfully by Knox Capture. Overview For example, assuming you've set a symbol count range of 7 - 20 for Code 128 barcodes, the following situations may occur: Code ""1234567"" (length 7) can be successfully scanned. Code ""12345678"" (length 8) can be successfully scanned. Code ""123456"" (length 6) can't be successfully scanned. Code ""12345"" (length 5) can be successfully scanned. This is unexpected behavior. Code ""1234"" (length 4) can't be successfully scanned. Cause When setting the scan length, there's a difference between the number of digits or characters and the active symbol count. The correlation between characters and symbol counts depends on the encoding standard. For instance, Code 128 differs from Code 39. For Code 128, there are three different encoding schemes that can be mixed within a single Code 128 barcode to achieve the shortest possible code. Resolution Check which encoding standards your barcode data follows.",322

Knox Capture v1.2 release notes. This Knox Capture v1.2 release, scheduled to go live on July 30, 2021, includes several new features and improvements to existing functionality. Starting with Knox Capture v1.2, devices running an Android version lower than 11 (R) are not supported. On these devices, downloading Knox Capture from the Google Play store installs v1.1 instead. All customers should upgrade devices to Android 11 (R) OS binary before v1.2 can be downloaded. Expanded device support In Knox Capture v1.2, support is added for the following devices: Galaxy XCover 4S, Galaxy Tab Active Pro, Galaxy S20, Galaxy S21 Only the keyboard scan icon and floating scan button are supported on non-rugged devices (S20 and S21). For a full list of supported devices, see Supported devices. Keystroke output support in WP-C deployments In previous Knox Capture versions, if an IT admin activated a KPE Premium license with a WP-C deployment, remote injection was blocked in WP-C mode. As a workaround, `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` must be set to True to support keystroke output. With this release, keystroke output in WP-C deployments is supported regardless of whether `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` is set to True. Keystroke output support is not yet available for Galaxy S20 devices. You must use the aforementioned workaround to use keystroke output on Galaxy S20 devices. Option to disable default profile IT admins can now enable or disable the default profile. If you create profiles for several applications and don't want the default profile's behavior to override any configurations, set the default profile to Off. The default profile setting is available on the Knox Capture main page. You can change the configuration at any time, export and deploy it to end users in Managed mode. If a profile is not active for an app or foreground activity and the end user attempts to scan a barcode, an error message is shown stating that the application does not support Knox Capture scanning. This setting cannot be changed in Managed mode. New floating button scan trigger !Hardware scan trigger setting !Hardware scan trigger setting A floating scan button is now available that launches the Knox Capture camera for scanning. By default, the scan button appears in the bottom right corner of the device's screen. Users can move it around the screen, and it remains in the last known position until it's toggled off. The scan button can be used in both Admin and Managed modes. See Set camera trigger for more information on the various available triggers. License activation menu for unmanaged devices Previously, Knox Capture licenses could only be used by organizations pushing them through an MDM. Starting from Knox Capture v1.2, IT admins can now activate Knox Capture licenses in-app using the new license activation menu. To deactivate an entered license key, uninstall the Knox Capture app from your device. The license activation menu is only available in Admin mode. For more information, see Activate your license. Support for exporting large configurations through QR code !Multiple QR code export This Knox Capture version extends the QR code export functionality to support larger configurations. Prior to v1.2, IT admins couldn't select QR code as the export method if the configuration size was too large. Now, multiple QR codes are generated in a PDF file for the end user to scan. The device prompts the user to scan them all before the configuration can be successfully imported to Knox Capture. To learn more, see Export a scanning configuration and Import a scanning configuration. Persistent scan sessions IT admins and end users can now pick up calls, switch apps, and clear tasks during scan sessions without losing scanned data. Rebooting the device has no impact on saved scan data. In multi-scan sessions where the user leaves the business app and returns, they are prompted to either continue the original scan session or begin a new one

With this release, the user simply has to connect to _device B_. Knox Capture automatically disconnects from any previously paired devices. #Receive a notification when overlay is restricted by IT admin Some device users may experience an issue where they are unable to view the camera preview window after triggering a scan. This issue can be caused by a restriction set by the IT admin and the organization's UEM policy. Previously, if the restriction was set, the user would simply not be able to see the preview window. In this release, the user will now get a notification asking them to contact their IT admin for more information. To learn more about the restriction, see the Knox Capture Knowledge Base Article (KBA) related to this issue. Back to release notes

Configure output path. Knox Capture can send scanned data to a Bluetooth-enabled device, like a PC, as a Human Interface Device (HID) keyboard, emulating the functionality of a hardware scanner. This feature is ideal for high-security enterprises with wireless network restrictions. For example, you might want to keep track of which assets are checked in or out of a restricted facility. In that case, you can use Knox Capture to scan an asset tag and send its data directly to a PC through Bluetooth. How it works The following describes how connected devices and scanned data are handled when using Knox Capture's Bluetooth wedge functionality: If the device is connected to a PC, output data is entered at the location of the keyboard cursor. Knox Capture applies any basic and advanced data formatting rules set in the default scanning profile to the output data. Only one Bluetooth-enabled device can be connected at a time. To connect to another device, you must first disconnect the current one. Scanning profiles are not supported, as Knox Capture operates as an HID keyboard. Connect a device To connect your device to a PC or other Bluetooth-enabled device using Knox Capture: 1. On the home screen, next to Profiles, tap the more actions menu icon. 2. Select Output path. 3. Under Bluetooth, toggle Use bluetooth wedge to the on position. 4. Under Paired devices, tap Make this device discoverable.

Knox Capture v1.7 release notes. New features #Launch of Samsung Knox Capture The most significant addition to Knox Capture v1.7 is the launch of a brand new, Samsung-developed scan engine that provides the same great feature-set as the Scandit engine, while also laying the foundations for Samsung to deliver exciting, industry-leading features to our customers in future releases. New customers will see an option to select their scan engine preference - either Knox Capture or Knox Capture: Scandit Edition - when launching the app for the first time and accepting the Knox Capture partner agreements. New customers can test the features of Knox Capture, and perform up to 100 free scans during their trial period, after which a valid Knox Suite license is required for commercial use. See Manage Knox Capture licenses to learn more about the new Knox Suite licensing requirements. #Knox Capture SDK This release introduces a brand new Knox Capture SDK to allow Android app developers to create their own barcode scanning applications. To learn more about our Knox Capture SDK, please visit our developer documentation site #Knox Capture AR (Augmented Reality) Version 1.7 of Knox Capture introduces a new AR (augmented reality) feature that displays an overlay on the device screen whenever one or more barcodes are scanned. IT admins can create AR templates to customize the information that displays on the overlay, as well as the overlay behavior. To get started with this exciting new feature, take a look at our Knox Capture AR guide for more information. #Low light scanning notification When using the camera to scan a barcode in low light conditions, a notification now displays in the capture preview window to suggest that the user enable their camera flashlight for better scanning results. This notification is enabled by default, but can be turned off by going to Knox Capture settings > Performance labs > Scanner toast notification. #Vibrate-notification after successful scan IT admins can now configure Knox Capture to vibrate the device after each successful barcode scan. This behavior is disabled by default, but can be enabled by going to a profile's Scan engine settings > Vibrate after scan. Enhancements #Output path accurately displays Paired devices list For customers who use their device as a Bluetooth wedge scanner to connect to a PC or host machine, Knox Capture now displays the Paired devices list only when the Use Bluetooth wedge slider is enabled. Previously, if a Bluetooth device was paired and the slider was in the OFF position, the Paired devices list would still show a list of disconnected devices. Now, the list only displays paired devices (connected or disconnected) if the slider is in the ON position. Known issues #Possible low barcode detection rate in certain glare or tiny conditions Testers have reported that Knox Capture can have difficulties detecting all barcodes under extreme glare conditions. It is recommended that users attempt to block or cover any glare on the barcodes before scanning. For customers who use Code 93 and Code 128 barcodes specifically, Knox Capture may have difficulties scanning barcodes that are too small. It is recommended that customers avoid using tiny barcodes whenver possible to increase the success rate of scans. #Possible difficulties using multiscan from far ranges Testers have reported some difficulties when attempting to scan multiple barcode technologies at the same time, at ranges farther than 16 cm (6 in). It is recommended that users move in closer to the barcodes when using multiscan. Back to release notes

How can an enterprise determine if Knox Capture is an appropriate app for their needs?,"An enterprise can determine if it is an appropriate app for their need if an IT admin is required to configure Knox Capture for business apps and it is best paired with an EMM for deployment, configuration, and license activation."," Based on the context, an enterprise can determine if Knox Capture is right for them in a few ways:

Knox Capture works best when paired with an EMM (enterprise mobility management) solution for deployment, configuration, and license management. So having an EMM is important.

It supports various use cases like creating barcode scanning profiles, testing those profiles with business apps, and exporting the profiles to deploy to end users. So it fits if an enterprise needs custom barcode scanning workflows.

There are two modes - Admin and Managed. The Admin mode allows full configuration and export ability, while the Managed mode limits end users to just scanning. So Knox Capture fits enterprises that need IT admin control plus end user scanning.

By testing Knox Capture's admin features and seeing if it integrates with an EMM for deployment, an enterprise can determine if the app meets their needs. The getting started tutorials also help validate fit.",1,1,6,1.0,0.9997567534446716,1.0,0,11.874785423278809,"How do I know if this app is right for my enterprise? . Knox Capture supports a variety of use cases, and works best when paired with an EMM for deployment, configuration, and license activation. A dedicated app manager, like an IT admin, is required to configure Knox Capture for business apps.

. #Admin mode (Default) When Knox Capture is downloaded from Google Play and installed on a compatible Android device - and a valid license key is activated - the app operates in its default Admin mode. This mode allows the device user - typically an enterprise IT admin - to utilize the full functionality of the app to primarily do the following: 1. Create scanning profiles that define which apps can launch the barcode scanner, which barcode types can be scanned (QR, Code 128, EAN8, etc.), and how scanned data is formatted (append Tab or Enter key, insert special characters before or after data, etc.). 2. Test scanning profiles to ensure that appropriate business apps can launch the scanner and receive data back as keystrokes. 3. Export profile settings as a configuration file, which can then be used by EMM/UEM administrators to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to end-user devices

. From the program's point of view, data appears exactly as if someone had typed it manually using a keyboard. How Knox Capture works In a similar way, Knox Capture also acts as a wedge between a software program and keyboard. However, instead of being a physical scanning device, Knox Capture is a mobile solution built for compatible Android smartphones and tablets. Enterprise IT admins can either download the Knox Capture app from Google Play, or custom-build their own wedge scanner apps using the Knox Capture SDK (Software Development Kit). Once Knox Capture is installed and running on a device, it *wedges* between an application (for example, a business app used to track inventory) and the mobile device's on-screen keyboard. When an end-user launches their business app, they can simply tap an on-screen button or press a hardware button on their device to trigger a barcode scan using the device's camera

. When an end-user launches their business app, they can simply tap an on-screen button or press a hardware button on their device to trigger a barcode scan using the device's camera. After the camera focuses on a barcode, Knox Capture translates the barcode data into keystrokes, which then get passed back to the business app for processing. From the business app's point of view, keystrokes coming from Knox Capture appear exactly as if a user had typed them from the device keyboard. Who can use Knox Capture? Knox Capture is designed for anyone who wants to turn their mobile device into a powerful barcode scanner. However, depending on whether it's being used by an admin or an end-user, its features vary significantly. #Admin mode (Default) When Knox Capture is downloaded from Google Play and installed on a compatible Android device - and a valid license key is activated - the app operates in its default Admin mode

Overview. Get started with the basics by learning what Knox Capture is and how it works. What is Knox Capture? To help explain what Knox Capture does, it may be helpful to start with an understanding of what a *wedge* scanner is, and how it relates to the Knox Capture solution. In traditional hardware-based barcode scanning terminology, a wedge scanner is a physical device that attaches between a keyboard and a computer. The keyboard attaches to the scanner, and the scanner attaches to the computer. From the computer's perspective, the scanner behaves just like an additional keyboard. When the computer runs a software program (like an inventory spreadsheet app), and barcodes are read using the wedge scanner, data is sent from the scanner to the program in the form of keystrokes. From the program's point of view, data appears exactly as if someone had typed it manually using a keyboard. How Knox Capture works In a similar way, Knox Capture also acts as a wedge between a software program and keyboard. However, instead of being a physical scanning device, Knox Capture is a mobile solution built for compatible Android smartphones and tablets. Enterprise IT admins can either download the Knox Capture app from Google Play, or custom-build their own wedge scanner apps using the Knox Capture SDK (Software Development Kit). Once Knox Capture is installed and running on a device, it *wedges* between an application (for example, a business app used to track inventory) and the mobile device's on-screen keyboard. When an end-user launches their business app, they can simply tap an on-screen button or press a hardware button on their device to trigger a barcode scan using the device's camera. After the camera focuses on a barcode, Knox Capture translates the barcode data into keystrokes, which then get passed back to the business app for processing. From the business app's point of view, keystrokes coming from Knox Capture appear exactly as if a user had typed them from the device keyboard. Who can use Knox Capture? Knox Capture is designed for anyone who wants to turn their mobile device into a powerful barcode scanner. However, depending on whether it's being used by an admin or an end-user, its features vary significantly. #Admin mode (Default) When Knox Capture is downloaded from Google Play and installed on a compatible Android device - and a valid license key is activated - the app operates in its default Admin mode. This mode allows the device user - typically an enterprise IT admin - to utilize the full functionality of the app to primarily do the following: 1. Create scanning profiles that define which apps can launch the barcode scanner, which barcode types can be scanned (QR, Code 128, EAN8, etc.), and how scanned data is formatted (append Tab or Enter key, insert special characters before or after data, etc.). 2. Test scanning profiles to ensure that appropriate business apps can launch the scanner and receive data back as keystrokes. 3. Export profile settings as a configuration file, which can then be used by EMM/UEM administrators to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to end-user devices. #Managed mode After an IT admin uses their EMM/UEM to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to an end-user's device, the device launches the app in Managed mode. In Managed mode, Knox Capture functionality is greatly reduced. End-users can review their scanning profile settings and perform barcode scans using their business apps (as permitted by their scanning profile), however they can't make changes to their scanning profiles, export profile settings, or switch to Admin mode by activating a Knox Capture license. Admin mode is the default mode of operation for Knox Capture. The procedures described in this guide are targeted at an IT admin audience.

Overview On Verizon XCover Pro devices, the XCover key is mapped to Verizon PTT (Push to Talk). This mapping prevents the device from triggering a camera scan when the user presses that key. How do I set the XCover key to trigger a camera scan on a Verizon XCover Pro device? There are two ways to override the Verizon PTT mapping: Disable the Verizon PTT key mapping, Set the XCover key to trigger a camera scan Disable the Verizon PTT key mapping on a single device before installing Knox Capture This procedure describes how to disable the Verizon PTT key mapping on a Verizon XCover Pro device. Perform this procedure before installing Knox Capture on the device. This procedure is useful if you're still in the process of testing Knox Capture on a device. If your goal is to configure a group of Verizon XCover Pro devices, see Set the XCover key to trigger a camera scan on a group of Verizon XCover Pro devices instead. This procedure assumes that you haven't installed Knox Capture on the device. 1. On the device, tap Settings > Advanced features > XCover Key and switch off Verizon PTT. 2. Install Knox Capture. During installation, Knox Capture trigger is automatically assigned to the XCover key's Press action. You can verify this by going to Settings > Advanced features > XCover Key. Set the XCover key to trigger a camera scan on a group of Verizon XCover Pro devices This procedure describes how to use your EMM to disable the Verizon PTT key mapping on Verizon XCover Pro devices and program the XCover key to trigger a camera scan. In this procedure, Knox Manage is used to illustrate the steps, but the steps are similar for other EMMs. This procedure assumes you've set up the Knox Service Plugin app with your EMM and that Knox Capture is installed on the devices. 1. On your EMM console, open the Knox Service Plugin policies. To do this on the Knox Manage console, add or modify an Android Enterprise profile. Then, in the Samsung Knox policies, click Knox Service Plugin. For information on how to open the Knox Service Plugin policies on a different EMM, refer to that EMM's documentation. 2. Under Device-wide policies, set Enable device policy controls to True. 3. Under Device Key Mapping (Premium), configure the mapping: 1. Set Enable Key Mapping Controls to True. 2. Set Enable PTT/Side Key Mapping for Microsoft Teams to False. 3. For Package Name, enter com.samsung.android.app.smartscan. 4. For Intent for Key press, enter com.samsung.android.knox.intent.action.PTT_PRESS. 5. For Intent for Key release, enter com.samsung.android.knox.intent.action.PTT_RELEASE. 6. Set Enable Key Mapping to Launch & Exit applications to False. 4. Save and assign the configured profile to the Verizon XCover Pro devices. 5. Verify that the configuration was applied successfully: 1. On one of the devices, launch the KSP app and tap Apply policies. 2.

For example, if `IntentOutputActivity` is receiving the intent, Knox Capture needs to configure the action as `intent.action.activity` and the category as `android.intent.category.DEFAULT`. Intent delivery - The app activity that handles the intent-based data. Refer to Intent output settings for descriptions of each activity. For more details on how to find the intent filter information, see Edit the AndroidManifest.xml file. At any time, change the apps designated for intent output by tapping Manage app packages under Intent output. Intent output settings Refer to the following settings to configure an Android intent: The intent action and category must match the ones defined in your business app's `AndroidManifest.xml` file, under a component's `intent-filter` element. For detailed instructions, contact the developers of the app. Application package name - Selects one or more apps to receive the intent. Intent action - Designates an action to handle the intent. Intent category - Sets the category of the intent action. Intent delivery - Selects one of three delivery methods for intent-based data: 1. Send via startActivity - Launches the activity to pass data through. 2. Send via startForeground - Creates a foreground service from an activity or app component to pass data through. This option is only available for devices running Android 8 and above. 3. Broadcast Intent - Gives the business app's broadcast receiver foreground priority on the device to speed up data delivery. Use this delivery method only if you're experiencing delays when sending scanned data immediately after the device is booted. After you configure an Android intent, the intent delivery method is added to the blue test overlay in Test mode. Refer to Use test mode for steps on how to check your configuration.

Export and deploy configuration. Knox Capture uses a simple EMM-based deployment model. You first need to export a scanning configuration as a .txt file, then use an EMM add the file to your app configuration to deploy Knox Capture as a managed-app to your end-users. Exporting a configuration Exporting and sharing a scan configuration enables other devices apply the configuration to their installation. #Export options An IT admin can use several methods to export the configuration: Save it as a file on the device. Email it as a file attachment. Use Nearby share to send to another IT admin's device, Generate a QR code that can be scanned by other IT admins. To share a configuration on a per-device basis, transfer the configuration using near-field communication (NFC) or with a QR code. #Launch the export menu Regardless of the export method selected, begin by tapping the Share button in the lower-right of the home page to launch the Share configuration menu. #Save as file To save the file: 1. Tap the Save icon in the Share configuration menu. 2. Enter a name and tap Done. Knox Capture saves the configuration within My Files > Downloads, and displays a success message. #Email file To email the configuration as a text file attachment with the default email program: 1. Tap the email icon within the Share configuration menu. 2. Knox Capture launches the email application and starts a new message with the configuration file attached. #Nearby share To share a configuration with another device using Nearby share: 1. Tap the Nearby icon within the Share configuration menu. 2. Ensure Nearby Share is turned on for both the transmitting and receiving devices. 3. On the receiving device, tap the Device nearby is sharing popup that appears. #QR code To generate a QR code that can be scanned by other devices to import the configuration, tap the QR code option in the Share configuration menu. Knox Capture generates and displays a QR code. Optionally save or email the QR code by tapping either the Save or Email button. Tap Save to save the QR code as an image within the device My Files > Downloads folder. Tap Email to launch the default email app. The resulting email message includes instructions for importing the configuration using the QR code. If the configuration is too large for one QR code, Knox Capture generates multiple QR codes in a PDF file. The end user must scan them all to complete the import process. Deploying through an EMM To deploy Knox Capture with a custom scanning configuration across a fleet of devices, set the scan configuration and use the EMM console to add it to Knox Capture's App Config in Managed Google Play. Doing so ensures devices that the app runs for end-users in Managed mode. Deployment varies depending on the EMM provider, but should resemble the following flow: 1. Install Knox Capture on an admin device, configure the app, and export the configuration as a text file. 2. Add the Knox Capture app to your Managed Google Play Store. 3. Assign the app to a group or organization and launch the app configuration dialog. In most consoles, the app configuration (or App Config) dialog opens as a pop-up window or modal. 4. Activate your license in the EMM. 5. Copy and paste the text of the exported Knox Capture configuration into the provided configuration field. 6. Save the updated settings and deploy. If you do not add a configuration for Knox Capture in Managed Google Play when updating a license key, the app operates according to its _previous_ configuration. For example, a device with an existing scan configuration will continue to operate in Managed mode after updating the license key. However, a new device without an existing configuration will operate in Admin mode. To ensure _all_ devices operate in Managed mode, prepare and include the configuration each time you add or modify the app within the EMM console. Sharing and importing configurations Once a configuration has been exported, it can be shared with other devices running the app in Admin mode

Overview. Get started with the basics by learning what Knox Capture is and how it works. What is Knox Capture? To help explain what Knox Capture does, it may be helpful to start with an understanding of what a *wedge* scanner is, and how it relates to the Knox Capture solution. In traditional hardware-based barcode scanning terminology, a wedge scanner is a physical device that attaches between a keyboard and a computer. The keyboard attaches to the scanner, and the scanner attaches to the computer. From the computer's perspective, the scanner behaves just like an additional keyboard. When the computer runs a software program (like an inventory spreadsheet app), and barcodes are read using the wedge scanner, data is sent from the scanner to the program in the form of keystrokes. From the program's point of view, data appears exactly as if someone had typed it manually using a keyboard. How Knox Capture works In a similar way, Knox Capture also acts as a wedge between a software program and keyboard",408

Then, trigger the camera scanner, and tap the flashlight icon in the upper-left corner of the screen to turn the flashlight on or off. Additional information For more information on how to configure the Knox Capture scanner, see Scan engine settings.

Configure scan engine settings. Scan engine settings define the core Knox Capture behavior, such as how barcodes are scanned, and what happens with the data after each scan. The following settings are available: Barcode types Choose the barcode symbologies the scanner should recognize. For example, Code 39, and QR code. Available barcode types: Type , Options - , - Numeric-only (1D) , Codabar, EAN13, EAN8, Interleaved 2 of 5, UPCA, UPCE Alphanumeric (1D) , Code 128, Code 39, Code 93 2D , Data Matrix, PDF417, QR Every barcode except Codabar and Code 93 is enabled by default. Scanning settings Use scan settings to define how barcodes are scanned, selected, and parsed before Knox Capture sends them to a target business application. #Scan mode Sets the primary capture mode for scanning. Available options: Setting , Option - , - Single scan (default) , Scans and parses one barcode at a time. Multi scan , Detects multiple barcodes in the scan area at the same time. #Single scan preferences Sets the way a user selects barcodes when interacting with the camera scanning UI in Single scan mode. Available options: Setting Options Barcode selection Automatic (default) &mdash; Captures the first-detected barcode without additional user input. Aim and scan &mdash; Requires the user to aim the camera at a barcode and tap the Scan button to capture barcode data. Continuous scanning Off (default) On &mdash; Allow device users to scan several barcodes in sequence (and have each scan be registered as a single event) without having to press the camera trigger button between each scan.1 1 Device users will see a Scan button in the camera preview window when they trigger a barcode scan. Device users can simply tap Scan each time they want to capture a new barcode. As each barcode is scanned, a counter in the top-left corner of the preview window gets updated. Once the user is finished scanning, they can click Done to close the camera preview window and return to the business app. #Multi scan preferences Sets the way a user selects barcodes when interacting with the camera scanning UI in Multi scan mode. Available options: Setting Options Barcode selection Automatic (default) &mdash; Allows the user to scan multiple barcodes without having to press a scan button. Batch &mdash; Lets the user scan multiple barcodes in a single camera frame using the scan button. Aim and scan &mdash; Requires the user to aim the camera at a set of barcodes and tap the Scan button to capture the barcodes, one at a time. Tap to select &mdash; Lets a user aim the camera at multiple barcodes, freeze the scanning overlay, tap to select barcodes, and tap the Scan button to capture data from the selected barcodes. Scan session limit This defines the number of barcodes a user must scan before the camera preview window closes. A counter in the top-left corner of the preview window gets updated after each scan. Once the user has scanned the set number of barcodes, the camera preview window closes and the user returns to the business app. Users can exit the camera preview window at any time by tapping Done, regardless of the number of barcodes captured. You can set any integer value. By default, this value is set to 0 to indicate infinite scans. #Beep after scan Emits a beep sound after each barcode scan. This is toggled On by default. #Vibrate after scan Vibrates the device after each barcode scan. This is toggled On by default. Camera settings Customize camera hardware and scanning UI options using the following settings: Setting Options Default Camera Back (default) Front Flashlight Off (default) &mdash; When a scan is triggered, the flashlight is turned off. A flashlight button is provided in the preview, and the button is off. On &mdash; When a scan is triggered, the flashlight is automatically turned on. A flashlight button is provided in the preview, and the button is on. Auto2 &mdash; When a scan is triggered, the device automatically monitors the light level to turn the flashlights ON and OFF. A flashlight button is not provided in the preview

. Now, in Single scan preferences, you can turn on Continuous scanning to scan back-to-back barcodes without relaunching the camera preview after every scan. This feature maximizes worker efficiency when used with a Bluetooth wedge or the scanner overlay. Improvements to configuration behavior after profile mode change With this release, if a Knox Capture profile is pushed to a device in Admin mode through a UEM, the device enters Managed mode and removes any configurations previously applied in Admin mode. For example, consider a device user who's conducting practice scans in Admin mode. Upon receiving a profile configuration, a notification on the device confirms that the configuration updated, and Knox Capture automatically turns off test mode and clears the test results. PDF417 barcode support for default profiles Starting with Knox Capture v1.5, default profiles now include the PDF417 barcode type

Knox Capture v1.1 release notes. Landscape mode support With this new update, Knox Capture can now be used in landscape mode on all supported devices. Frontline workers can choose to scan barcodes or navigate the app UI in either portrait or landscape mode, allowing more robust scan capability. Added device model support Extending Knox Capture's device lineup, the Galaxy XCover 5 has been added to the list of supported devices in v1.1. Advanced data formatting With v1.1, custom rules can be configured to trigger or block actions based on a set of criteria. Advanced data formatting allows you to move the cursor, modify, send, or delay data sent to an input field. For example, you can create a rule to send only the last 4 digits of a barcode to a business app. For more information, refer to Advanced data formatting. Keyboard scan button input method A scan button has been added to the device keyboard that launches the Knox Capture camera for scanning. On devices running OneUI 2

Overview. Get started with the basics by learning what Knox Capture is and how it works. What is Knox Capture? To help explain what Knox Capture does, it may be helpful to start with an understanding of what a *wedge* scanner is, and how it relates to the Knox Capture solution. In traditional hardware-based barcode scanning terminology, a wedge scanner is a physical device that attaches between a keyboard and a computer. The keyboard attaches to the scanner, and the scanner attaches to the computer. From the computer's perspective, the scanner behaves just like an additional keyboard. When the computer runs a software program (like an inventory spreadsheet app), and barcodes are read using the wedge scanner, data is sent from the scanner to the program in the form of keystrokes. From the program's point of view, data appears exactly as if someone had typed it manually using a keyboard. How Knox Capture works In a similar way, Knox Capture also acts as a wedge between a software program and keyboard",468
What specific scanner engine settings and data processing rules can an IT admin modify when using the default scanning profile?,"When using the default scanning profile, IT admins can change the profile's scan engine settings and data processing rules, however they cannot change the default profile's apps and activities behaviour."," The specific scanner engine settings and data processing rules that an IT admin can modify when using the default scanning profile include:

1) Barcode types: An IT admin can add or remove specific supported barcode types. The default profile automatically includes Code 128, Code 39, DataMatrix, EAN8, Interleaved 2 of 5, QR, UPCA, and UPCE barcode types.

2) Camera behaviors: The flash/torch can be turned on or off by the IT admin, and camera zoom capabilities can be enabled or disabled.

3) Keystroke output rules: The IT admin can specify how barcode data is converted into keyboard strokes, such as appending Tab or Enter characters, adding prefix or suffix characters, converting to hex characters, etc.

The key point is that while using the default profile, IT admins cannot change which apps can trigger the scanner or which activities in those apps can launch scans. But they do have control over barcode types, camera settings, and keystroke output formatting rules.",1,1,6,1.0,0.9981638789176941,1.0,0,21.174686670303345,". When using the default scanning profile, IT admins can change the profile's scan engine settings and data processing rules, however they cannot change the default profile's apps and activities behavior. For example, an IT admin can modify the default profile to append a Tab key at the end of each barcode, but they cannot change which apps can trigger the scanner. Custom scanning profiles While the default scanning profile allows Knox Capture to be used right away without any configuration, IT admins may want to use a custom profile to better suit their needs. With a custom profile, IT admins control which apps and activities can trigger a barcode scan. Any apps that you don't select in the custom profile will follow the default behavior in that the barcode scanner is active for all apps not specified in the custom profile. Creating custom scanning profiles Custom profiles can be created by modifying the default profile settings, or by creating entirely new profiles altogether. 1

. 2. Scanner engine settings - specifying the barcode technologies (QR, Code 128, UPCA, etc.), scanning methods (single barcode, multi barcode), and camera behavior (enable flash, allow camera zoom). 3. Keystroke output rules - specifying how barcode data gets converted into keystrokes (append Tab or Enter character to each barcode, add prefix or suffix characters, convert output to hex characters, etc.) Default scanning profile Out-of-the-box, Knox Capture includes a default scanning profile that gets automatically associated with all apps on the device. In other words, when Knox Capture is launched, *any* app can trigger the camera scanner and receive barcode data in the form of keystrokes. This makes it easy to use Knox Capture for basic scanning purposes without any additional setup. When using the default scanning profile, IT admins can change the profile's scan engine settings and data processing rules, however they cannot change the default profile's apps and activities behavior

Scanning profiles. Knox Capture acts as a wedge by translating barcode data into keystrokes that can be sent to a business application. But how does Knox Capture know what barcode types to scan, how to interpret scanned data, and which business applications to pass the data to? For Knox Capture, the *Scanning profile* defines the app's core behavior. A Scanning Profile is a configuration file that gets created or modified by an IT admin using the Knox Capture application. The profile defines how Knox Capture performs a barcode scan, and primarily consists of the following parameters: 1. Apps and activities - define which applications that can launch the Knox Capture scanner. 2. Scanner engine settings - specifying the barcode technologies (QR, Code 128, UPCA, etc.), scanning methods (single barcode, multi barcode), and camera behavior (enable flash, allow camera zoom). 3

. Apps and activities - The component of every scanning profile that defines which busiess apps can launch the camera scanner. Learn how apps and activities work, and how you can customize them in the scanning profiles. Scan engine settings - These settings define how barcodes are scanned, and what happens with the data after each scan. Learn how to set barcode types, change scan modes, control viewfinder size, and more. Keystroke output - The scanning profile setting that defines how data is formatted after each successful scan. Learn how to append or prepend special characters to scanned data, or how to insert ASCII Tabs and Enter keys at the end of each barcode to allow for easier processing in spreadsheets and forms. Test mode - A feature that lets you test a scanning profile's apps, barcode types, and keystroke ouput rules before exporting the configuration for deployment

In other words, when Knox Capture is launched, *any* app can trigger the camera scanner and receive barcode data in the form of keystrokes. This makes it easy to use Knox Capture for basic scanning purposes without any additional setup. When using the default scanning profile, IT admins can change the profile's scan engine settings and data processing rules, however they cannot change the default profile's apps and activities behavior. For example, an IT admin can modify the default profile to append a Tab key at the end of each barcode, but they cannot change which apps can trigger the scanner. Custom scanning profiles While the default scanning profile allows Knox Capture to be used right away without any configuration, IT admins may want to use a custom profile to better suit their needs. With a custom profile, IT admins control which apps and activities can trigger a barcode scan. Any apps that you don't select in the custom profile will follow the default behavior in that the barcode scanner is active for all apps not specified in the custom profile. Creating custom scanning profiles Custom profiles can be created by modifying the default profile settings, or by creating entirely new profiles altogether. 1. Tap the + button near the top of the app UI to open the profile creation options. 2. Select Create profile to start a profile from scratch, or select Duplicate existing profile to copy the settings from an existing (custom or default) profile. Alternatively, you can create a custom profile by clicking Create profile without clicking the + button. 3. Provide a profile name, then tap Done. The new profile appears in the profiles area below Defult scanning profile.

. Step 2: Edit the default profile Tap Default scanning profile to explore and edit the profile settings. Note that you cannot change the profile's App list, as the default scanning profile works with all apps on the device. Review Scanning profiles for more information. Step 3: Change scan engine settings On the Default scanning profile screen, tap Knox Capture in the Scanner field to view or change the scan engine settings. In this example, you'll learn how to: Update the profile's list of supported barcode types. Enable a flashlight button during a barcode scan. To change these scan engine settings: 1. Tap Barcode types, then scroll down to review the selected types. Upon creation, profiles automatically use Code 128, Code 39, DataMatrix, EAN8, Interleaved 2 of 5, QR, UPCA, and UPCE. Add or remove a barcode type of your choice. For best performance, only select the barcode types necessary when creating the profile. 2. Tap Save to return to the Scan engine settings screen. 3",981

1. Tap the + button near the top of the app UI to open the profile creation options. Then select Create profile to start a profile from scratch, or select Duplicate existing profile to copy the settings from an existing (custom or default) profile. 

2. Create a custom profile by clicking Create profile without clicking the + button.",1,1,6,1.0,0.29471686482429504,0.0,0,3.934025764465332,". Creating custom scanning profiles Custom profiles can be created by modifying the default profile settings, or by creating entirely new profiles altogether. 1. Tap the + button near the top of the app UI to open the profile creation options. 2. Select Create profile to start a profile from scratch, or select Duplicate existing profile to copy the settings from an existing (custom or default) profile. Alternatively, you can create a custom profile by clicking Create profile without clicking the + button. 3. Provide a profile name, then tap Done. The new profile appears in the profiles area below Defult scanning profile.

. When using the default scanning profile, IT admins can change the profile's scan engine settings and data processing rules, however they cannot change the default profile's apps and activities behavior. For example, an IT admin can modify the default profile to append a Tab key at the end of each barcode, but they cannot change which apps can trigger the scanner. Custom scanning profiles While the default scanning profile allows Knox Capture to be used right away without any configuration, IT admins may want to use a custom profile to better suit their needs. With a custom profile, IT admins control which apps and activities can trigger a barcode scan. Any apps that you don't select in the custom profile will follow the default behavior in that the barcode scanner is active for all apps not specified in the custom profile. Creating custom scanning profiles Custom profiles can be created by modifying the default profile settings, or by creating entirely new profiles altogether. 1

Scanning profiles. Knox Capture acts as a wedge by translating barcode data into keystrokes that can be sent to a business application. But how does Knox Capture know what barcode types to scan, how to interpret scanned data, and which business applications to pass the data to? For Knox Capture, the *Scanning profile* defines the app's core behavior. A Scanning Profile is a configuration file that gets created or modified by an IT admin using the Knox Capture application. The profile defines how Knox Capture performs a barcode scan, and primarily consists of the following parameters: 1. Apps and activities - define which applications that can launch the Knox Capture scanner. 2. Scanner engine settings - specifying the barcode technologies (QR, Code 128, UPCA, etc.), scanning methods (single barcode, multi barcode), and camera behavior (enable flash, allow camera zoom). 3. Keystroke output rules - specifying how barcode data gets converted into keystrokes (append Tab or Enter character to each barcode, add prefix or suffix characters, convert output to hex characters, etc.) Default scanning profile Out-of-the-box, Knox Capture includes a default scanning profile that gets automatically associated with all apps on the device. In other words, when Knox Capture is launched, *any* app can trigger the camera scanner and receive barcode data in the form of keystrokes. This makes it easy to use Knox Capture for basic scanning purposes without any additional setup. When using the default scanning profile, IT admins can change the profile's scan engine settings and data processing rules, however they cannot change the default profile's apps and activities behavior. For example, an IT admin can modify the default profile to append a Tab key at the end of each barcode, but they cannot change which apps can trigger the scanner. Custom scanning profiles While the default scanning profile allows Knox Capture to be used right away without any configuration, IT admins may want to use a custom profile to better suit their needs. With a custom profile, IT admins control which apps and activities can trigger a barcode scan. Any apps that you don't select in the custom profile will follow the default behavior in that the barcode scanner is active for all apps not specified in the custom profile. Creating custom scanning profiles Custom profiles can be created by modifying the default profile settings, or by creating entirely new profiles altogether. 1. Tap the + button near the top of the app UI to open the profile creation options. 2. Select Create profile to start a profile from scratch, or select Duplicate existing profile to copy the settings from an existing (custom or default) profile. Alternatively, you can create a custom profile by clicking Create profile without clicking the + button. 3. Provide a profile name, then tap Done. The new profile appears in the profiles area below Defult scanning profile.

. Apps and activities - The component of every scanning profile that defines which busiess apps can launch the camera scanner. Learn how apps and activities work, and how you can customize them in the scanning profiles. Scan engine settings - These settings define how barcodes are scanned, and what happens with the data after each scan. Learn how to set barcode types, change scan modes, control viewfinder size, and more. Keystroke output - The scanning profile setting that defines how data is formatted after each successful scan. Learn how to append or prepend special characters to scanned data, or how to insert ASCII Tabs and Enter keys at the end of each barcode to allow for easier processing in spreadsheets and forms. Test mode - A feature that lets you test a scanning profile's apps, barcode types, and keystroke ouput rules before exporting the configuration for deployment

. Step 2: Edit the default profile Tap Default scanning profile to explore and edit the profile settings. Note that you cannot change the profile's App list, as the default scanning profile works with all apps on the device. Review Scanning profiles for more information. Step 3: Change scan engine settings On the Default scanning profile screen, tap Knox Capture in the Scanner field to view or change the scan engine settings. In this example, you'll learn how to: Update the profile's list of supported barcode types. Enable a flashlight button during a barcode scan. To change these scan engine settings: 1. Tap Barcode types, then scroll down to review the selected types. Upon creation, profiles automatically use Code 128, Code 39, DataMatrix, EAN8, Interleaved 2 of 5, QR, UPCA, and UPCE. Add or remove a barcode type of your choice. For best performance, only select the barcode types necessary when creating the profile. 2. Tap Save to return to the Scan engine settings screen. 3

How do I enforce Managed mode on enterprise devices . Managed mode is automatically applied when Knox Capture is configured and deployed through an EMM console. For details on deploying the app in Managed mode, see Deployment.

. 3. Export profile settings as a configuration file, which can then be used by EMM/UEM administrators to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to end-user devices. #Managed mode After an IT admin uses their EMM/UEM to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to an end-user's device, the device launches the app in Managed mode. In Managed mode, Knox Capture functionality is greatly reduced. End-users can review their scanning profile settings and perform barcode scans using their business apps (as permitted by their scanning profile), however they can't make changes to their scanning profiles, export profile settings, or switch to Admin mode by activating a Knox Capture license. Admin mode is the default mode of operation for Knox Capture. The procedures described in this guide are targeted at an IT admin audience. Further reading #Getting started tutorials These tutorials provide a guided workflow for new admins and end-users

Export and deploy configuration. Knox Capture uses a simple EMM-based deployment model. You first need to export a scanning configuration as a .txt file, then use an EMM add the file to your app configuration to deploy Knox Capture as a managed-app to your end-users. Exporting a configuration Exporting and sharing a scan configuration enables other devices apply the configuration to their installation. #Export options An IT admin can use several methods to export the configuration: Save it as a file on the device. Email it as a file attachment. Use Nearby share to send to another IT admin's device, Generate a QR code that can be scanned by other IT admins. To share a configuration on a per-device basis, transfer the configuration using near-field communication (NFC) or with a QR code. #Launch the export menu Regardless of the export method selected, begin by tapping the Share button in the lower-right of the home page to launch the Share configuration menu. #Save as file To save the file: 1.

Refer to Intent output settings for descriptions of each activity. For more details on how to find the intent filter information, see Edit the AndroidManifest.xml file. At any time, change the apps designated for intent output by tapping Manage app packages under Intent output. Intent output settings Refer to the following settings to configure an Android intent: The intent action and category must match the ones defined in your business app's `AndroidManifest.xml` file, under a component's `intent-filter` element. For detailed instructions, contact the developers of the app. Application package name - Selects one or more apps to receive the intent. Intent action - Designates an action to handle the intent. Intent category - Sets the category of the intent action. Intent delivery - Selects one of three delivery methods for intent-based data: 1

. For business app developers #Edit the AndroidManifest.xml file For your business app to parse the scanned data, you need to set up Knox Capture to send it the correct intent output. To do so, edit AndroidManifest.xml to define the package name, intent action and category. Knox Capture offers three different methods for your app to receive an Android intent. Refer to Intent output settings for more details. The following is a snippet demonstrating the manifest information to edit. Ensure you replace any dummy strings with ones relevant to your app. ``` PackageName = applicationId ""com.test.smartscan"" AndroidManifest.xml ``` If you're using an activity to receive the intent: ``` ``` If you're using the foreground service to receive the intent: ``` ``` If you're using the broadcast receiver to receive the intent: ``` ``` Properly defining the intent filter information ensures that after each successful scan, Knox Capture delivers the intent to your business app through the chosen method

Use intent output. If your business app needs to obtain scanned data programmatically (for example, to process it further in-app), Knox Capture can pass the data within an Android intent object instead of through keystroke output. You can also enable intent output to work with keystroke output. For example, if you select Send via startActivity as your intent delivery method, Knox Capture first sends keystrokes to the foreground activity, then sends the intent to the new activity instance. To use Knox Capture's intent output feature: Business app developers must ensure the business app receives the intent, and, IT admins must configure Knox Capture's Intent output feature accordingly. The information in this section is divided into instructions for business app developers and instructions for Knox Capture admins. For business app developers #Edit the AndroidManifest.xml file For your business app to parse the scanned data, you need to set up Knox Capture to send it the correct intent output

. Intent action - `intent.action.activity`, Intent category - `intent.category.DEFAULT`, Intent delivery - `Send via startActivity`, Component information - `test.smartscan` For Knox Capture admins To set up intent output: 1.

Select the apps for intent output, then tap < in the top left to return to the previous screen. Make sure the package name matches your business app. 4. Under Intent output, specify an Intent action, Intent category, and Intent delivery method to handle the intent. Intent action and category - The intent filter information matching the business app's intent filter information. For example, if `IntentOutputActivity` is receiving the intent, Knox Capture needs to configure the action as `intent.action.activity` and the category as `android.intent.category.DEFAULT`. Intent delivery - The app activity that handles the intent-based data

Intent category - Sets the category of the intent action. Intent delivery - Selects one of three delivery methods for intent-based data: 1. Send via startActivity - Launches the activity to pass data through. 2. Send via startForeground - Creates a foreground service from an activity or app component to pass data through. This option is only available for devices running Android 8 and above. 3. Broadcast Intent - Gives the business app's broadcast receiver foreground priority on the device to speed up data delivery. Use this delivery method only if you're experiencing delays when sending scanned data immediately after the device is booted. After you configure an Android intent, the intent delivery method is added to the blue test overlay in Test mode. Refer to Use test mode for steps on how to check your configuration.",584

Scanning overlay doesn't appear when launching the camera. Overview Some device users experience an issue where they are unable to view the scanner overlay after launching the device's camera for use as a scanner. Cause The issue occurs when the Android Enterprise policy that controls the DISALLOW_CREATE_WINDOWS boolean sets it to true. This boolean specifies whether or not apps can open secondary windows. By default, the value of this boolean is false, allowing apps like Knox Capture to create a window for the scanner overlay every time the camera launches. If a device policy sets this boolean to true, then Knox Capture won't be able to create the scanner overlay window when the camera launches. Resolution Ensure that the policy in your UEM profile that controls this value sets it to the equivalent of false. For Knox Manage customers, set the Create Window policy to Allow. For all other UEMs, refer to their documentation on Android Enterprise policies.

In this release, your users can now scan inverted-color barcodes on all available barcode types. To learn how to use this feature, see Configure scan engine settings. #Support for QR code license scanning To help speed up the license activation workflow for end-users, you can now generate a Knox Suite license as a QR code, then have end-users scan that QR code to automatically enter the license key in their app. Knox Capture does not generate a QR code for you. #Knox Capture SDK v1.1.0 This release of Knox Capture v1.9 also introduces a new version of the Knox Capture SDK for customers who wish to develop their own custom scanning applications. SDK v1.1

Configure scan engine settings. Scan engine settings define the core Knox Capture behavior, such as how barcodes are scanned, and what happens with the data after each scan. The following settings are available: Barcode types Choose the barcode symbologies the scanner should recognize. For example, Code 39, and QR code. Available barcode types: Type , Options - , - Numeric-only (1D) , Codabar, EAN13, EAN8, Interleaved 2 of 5, UPCA, UPCE Alphanumeric (1D) , Code 128, Code 39, Code 93 2D , Data Matrix, PDF417, QR Every barcode except Codabar and Code 93 is enabled by default.

Scanning profiles. Knox Capture acts as a wedge by translating barcode data into keystrokes that can be sent to a business application. But how does Knox Capture know what barcode types to scan, how to interpret scanned data, and which business applications to pass the data to? For Knox Capture, the *Scanning profile* defines the app's core behavior. A Scanning Profile is a configuration file that gets created or modified by an IT admin using the Knox Capture application. The profile defines how Knox Capture performs a barcode scan, and primarily consists of the following parameters: 1. Apps and activities - define which applications that can launch the Knox Capture scanner. 2. Scanner engine settings - specifying the barcode technologies (QR, Code 128, UPCA, etc.), scanning methods (single barcode, multi barcode), and camera behavior (enable flash, allow camera zoom). 3

. Change this property to include lengths not enabled by default, or to optimize decoding performance for a certain number of symbols. Character-to-symbol mapping depends on barcode type. For example, some barcodes include additional checksum characters in their symbol counts. For more information on active symbol count, refer to Configure the Active Symbol Count. Depends on barcode type. Max. length Determines the maximum supported barcode length (active symbol count) to decode. Depends on barcode type. Inverted color recognition Enables recognition of inverted barcodes that have been printed using bright ink on a dark background. ON/OFF OFF Reduced quiet zone-size Enables scanning codes with smaller than normal quiet zones (white space before and after the code) than allowed by the barcode type specification. Use this if you experience issues when scanning codes that violate quiet zone specifications. Please note that turning on this feature may lead to false positive scans in some cases",296
What new input method has been added to launch the Knox Capture camera for scanning?,A scan button has been added to the device keyboard.," If the question cannot be answered by the context, say ""No relevant context"".

Keystroke output data sent to browser or web app instead of business app. Overview Certain company-owned devices with a work profile might encounter an issue where barcode data sent through keystroke output is delivered to a browser or web app instead of the business app. Cause With recent improvements to company-owned devices with a work profile, a change was made to the way web apps - apps delivered through the browser instead of natively on Android - handle text view focus after scanning. On devices running Android 10 and lower, the text view is already in focus when scanned data returns to the business app. This focus behavior is no longer required with company-owned devices with a work profile running Android 11 and higher. Resolution To handle this change, you must enable the Allow remote control policy in your EMM to allow Knox Capture to restore focus to the text view. You only need to enable this policy if you've activated a Knox Platform for Enterprise Premium license.",269

Starting with Knox Capture v1.2, devices running an Android version lower than 11 (R) are not supported. On these devices, downloading Knox Capture from the Google Play store installs v1.1 instead. All customers should upgrade devices to Android 11 (R) OS binary before v1.2 can be downloaded. Expanded device support In Knox Capture v1.2, support is added for the following devices: Galaxy XCover 4S, Galaxy Tab Active Pro, Galaxy S20, Galaxy S21 Only the keyboard scan icon and floating scan button are supported on non-rugged devices (S20 and S21). For a full list of supported devices, see Supported devices. Keystroke output support in WP-C deployments In previous Knox Capture versions, if an IT admin activated a KPE Premium license with a WP-C deployment, remote injection was blocked in WP-C mode. As a workaround, `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` must be set to True to support keystroke output. With this release, keystroke output in WP-C deployments is supported regardless of whether `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` is set to True. Keystroke output support is not yet available for Galaxy S20 devices. You must use the aforementioned workaround to use keystroke output on Galaxy S20 devices. Option to disable default profile IT admins can now enable or disable the default profile. If you create profiles for several applications and don't want the default profile's behavior to override any configurations, set the default profile to Off. The default profile setting is available on the Knox Capture main page. You can change the configuration at any time, export and deploy it to end users in Managed mode. If a profile is not active for an app or foreground activity and the end user attempts to scan a barcode, an error message is shown stating that the application does not support Knox Capture scanning. This setting cannot be changed in Managed mode. New floating button scan trigger !Hardware scan trigger setting !Hardware scan trigger setting A floating scan button is now available that launches the Knox Capture camera for scanning. By default, the scan button appears in the bottom right corner of the device's screen. Users can move it around the screen, and it remains in the last known position until it's toggled off. The scan button can be used in both Admin and Managed modes. See Set camera trigger for more information on the various available triggers. License activation menu for unmanaged devices Previously, Knox Capture licenses could only be used by organizations pushing them through an MDM. Starting from Knox Capture v1.2, IT admins can now activate Knox Capture licenses in-app using the new license activation menu. To deactivate an entered license key, uninstall the Knox Capture app from your device. The license activation menu is only available in Admin mode. For more information, see Activate your license. Support for exporting large configurations through QR code !Multiple QR code export This Knox Capture version extends the QR code export functionality to support larger configurations. Prior to v1.2, IT admins couldn't select QR code as the export method if the configuration size was too large. Now, multiple QR codes are generated in a PDF file for the end user to scan. The device prompts the user to scan them all before the configuration can be successfully imported to Knox Capture. To learn more, see Export a scanning configuration and Import a scanning configuration. Persistent scan sessions IT admins and end users can now pick up calls, switch apps, and clear tasks during scan sessions without losing scanned data. Rebooting the device has no impact on saved scan data. In multi-scan sessions where the user leaves the business app and returns, they are prompted to either continue the original scan session or begin a new one

. Once the file has been shared, the receiving device can import the configuration by doing the following: Importing a configuration overrides existing Knox Capture settings on a device and is irreversible. 1. Tap the more actions menu icon within the home page to the right of the Profiles list label. Then select Import. 2. After launching the import configuration menu, acknowledge the warning message by tapping Confirm. 3. Find the configuration file to import. Knox Capture will import the configuration and display a success message: #Import with QR code If a configuration was shared via QR code, you can import the configuration by doing the following: 1. Tap the QR code icon within the import configuration menu to launch the camera scanner. 2. Direct the camera at the QR code. 3. After scanning the QR code, Knox Capture automatically imports the configuration and displays a success message. If the configuration is too large for one QR code, Knox Capture displays multiple QR codes in a PDF file. The end user must scan them all to complete the import process. If the user attempts to scan a QR code that isn't part of the same configuration, an error message is shown on the overlay until a different one is scanned.

Export and deploy configuration. Knox Capture uses a simple EMM-based deployment model. You first need to export a scanning configuration as a .txt file, then use an EMM add the file to your app configuration to deploy Knox Capture as a managed-app to your end-users. Exporting a configuration Exporting and sharing a scan configuration enables other devices apply the configuration to their installation. #Export options An IT admin can use several methods to export the configuration: Save it as a file on the device. Email it as a file attachment. Use Nearby share to send to another IT admin's device, Generate a QR code that can be scanned by other IT admins. To share a configuration on a per-device basis, transfer the configuration using near-field communication (NFC) or with a QR code. #Launch the export menu Regardless of the export method selected, begin by tapping the Share button in the lower-right of the home page to launch the Share configuration menu. #Save as file To save the file: 1. Tap the Save icon in the Share configuration menu. 2. Enter a name and tap Done. Knox Capture saves the configuration within My Files > Downloads, and displays a success message. #Email file To email the configuration as a text file attachment with the default email program: 1. Tap the email icon within the Share configuration menu. 2. Knox Capture launches the email application and starts a new message with the configuration file attached. #Nearby share To share a configuration with another device using Nearby share: 1. Tap the Nearby icon within the Share configuration menu. 2. Ensure Nearby Share is turned on for both the transmitting and receiving devices. 3. On the receiving device, tap the Device nearby is sharing popup that appears. #QR code To generate a QR code that can be scanned by other devices to import the configuration, tap the QR code option in the Share configuration menu. Knox Capture generates and displays a QR code. Optionally save or email the QR code by tapping either the Save or Email button. Tap Save to save the QR code as an image within the device My Files > Downloads folder. Tap Email to launch the default email app. The resulting email message includes instructions for importing the configuration using the QR code. If the configuration is too large for one QR code, Knox Capture generates multiple QR codes in a PDF file. The end user must scan them all to complete the import process. Deploying through an EMM To deploy Knox Capture with a custom scanning configuration across a fleet of devices, set the scan configuration and use the EMM console to add it to Knox Capture's App Config in Managed Google Play. Doing so ensures devices that the app runs for end-users in Managed mode. Deployment varies depending on the EMM provider, but should resemble the following flow: 1. Install Knox Capture on an admin device, configure the app, and export the configuration as a text file. 2. Add the Knox Capture app to your Managed Google Play Store. 3. Assign the app to a group or organization and launch the app configuration dialog. In most consoles, the app configuration (or App Config) dialog opens as a pop-up window or modal. 4. Activate your license in the EMM. 5. Copy and paste the text of the exported Knox Capture configuration into the provided configuration field. 6. Save the updated settings and deploy. If you do not add a configuration for Knox Capture in Managed Google Play when updating a license key, the app operates according to its _previous_ configuration. For example, a device with an existing scan configuration will continue to operate in Managed mode after updating the license key. However, a new device without an existing configuration will operate in Admin mode. To ensure _all_ devices operate in Managed mode, prepare and include the configuration each time you add or modify the app within the EMM console. Sharing and importing configurations Once a configuration has been exported, it can be shared with other devices running the app in Admin mode",528
What new scanner feature is available in Knox Capture v1.5 that enables users to see scanned data entered directly into app fields?,A scanner overlay is available as a feature in Knox Capture v1.5 that enables users to see scanned data entered directly into app fields. This feature works much like the full-screen scanner and appears over business apps.," No relevant context. The passage does not mention a specific scanner feature in Knox Capture v1.5 that enables users to see scanned data entered directly into app fields. It talks about a scanner overlay being introduced in v1.5, but does not give details on it allowing users to see scanned data entered into app fields.",1,1,6,1.0,0.8181313276290894,0.0,0,11.653157472610474,"Knox Capture v1.5 release notes. Scanner overlay Starting with Knox Capture v1.5, a scanner overlay is available. This overlay appears as a scanner preview over business apps, and enables device users to immediately see scanned data entered into an app field. Functionally, the scanner overlay works much like the full-screen scanner. When the device user aims the camera at the barcode, Knox Capture then sends the scanned data to the business app depending on whether single scan or multi-scan mode is enabled, and how Barcode selection is configured. See Use the scanner overlay to learn more. Continuous scanning for single scan mode Previously, when device users scanned single barcodes, the camera preview turned on before each scan, then off again once the scan was completed. Now, in Single scan preferences, you can turn on Continuous scanning to scan back-to-back barcodes without relaunching the camera preview after every scan

Use scanner overlay. The Scanner overlay feature lets device users view the camera preview window and the business app screen concurrently. When the user triggers a barcode scan, a mini camera preview is shown over the business app screen as a picture-in-picture (PiP) window, allowing users to use the scanner and view their app's data at the same time. Functionally, the Scanner overlay behaves just like the normal scanner. When the device user aims the camera at the barcode, Knox Capture sends the scanned data to the business app depending on how the scan engine settings are configured. Enable the Scanner overlay The Scanner overlay can be enabled in both Admin and Managed modes. To enable this feature, go to the Knox Capture home screen, tap the Options button (three dots), tap Scanner overlay, then toggle the feature On. When you launch the scanner overlay for the first time, an on-screen tutorial explains how to reposition and resize the overlay. By default, the overlay appears at the top of the screen.

Now, in Single scan preferences, you can turn on Continuous scanning to scan back-to-back barcodes without relaunching the camera preview after every scan. This feature maximizes worker efficiency when used with a Bluetooth wedge or the scanner overlay. Improvements to configuration behavior after profile mode change With this release, if a Knox Capture profile is pushed to a device in Admin mode through a UEM, the device enters Managed mode and removes any configurations previously applied in Admin mode. For example, consider a device user who's conducting practice scans in Admin mode. Upon receiving a profile configuration, a notification on the device confirms that the configuration updated, and Knox Capture automatically turns off test mode and clears the test results. PDF417 barcode support for default profiles Starting with Knox Capture v1.5, default profiles now include the PDF417 barcode type. The current barcode symbologies enabled in the default profile are: Code 128, QR, Code 39, EAN8, EAN13/UPCA, UPCE, Interleaved 2 of 5, Data Matrix, PDF417 Back to release notes

. 2. Scanner engine settings - specifying the barcode technologies (QR, Code 128, UPCA, etc.), scanning methods (single barcode, multi barcode), and camera behavior (enable flash, allow camera zoom). 3. Keystroke output rules - specifying how barcode data gets converted into keystrokes (append Tab or Enter character to each barcode, add prefix or suffix characters, convert output to hex characters, etc.) Default scanning profile Out-of-the-box, Knox Capture includes a default scanning profile that gets automatically associated with all apps on the device. In other words, when Knox Capture is launched, *any* app can trigger the camera scanner and receive barcode data in the form of keystrokes. This makes it easy to use Knox Capture for basic scanning purposes without any additional setup. When using the default scanning profile, IT admins can change the profile's scan engine settings and data processing rules, however they cannot change the default profile's apps and activities behavior

. If the user navigates to a different business app to initiate a scan instead, the original scan data is discarded. New indicators for tested app activities When testing configurations in Admin mode, IT admins can now view a list of created app activities under the profile. Any activity not visible in the list behaves under the default profile. After being tested, each activity displays a green checkmark to its right to indicate its tested status. Refer to Check a configuration in test mode to learn more. Hardware scanner support Knox Capture v1.2 adds support for USB and Bluetooth hardware scanners. After the scanner is paired or connected, IT admins and end users can switch between their device's camera and the scanner for seamless data capture and delivery to business apps. Currently, v1.2 supports all HW scanners with HID connection. Tests have been completed for the devices below: Koamtac KDC280 (Bluetooth), Koamtac KDC180 (Bluetooth), Koamtac SKXPro SmartSled (USB) - Only supported for Galaxy XCover Pro devices. For more information, see Connect a hardware scanner.

AR overview. The Knox Capture AR (Augmented Reality) is a feature that allows users to view important, business-critical information on the device screen when peforming a barcode scan. Normally, whenever a user launches the scanner, aims their camera at one or more barcodes, and captures the barcode data, Knox Capture simply passes the barcode information back to the business-app for review for the user to review. There is no way for the user to interact with any of the information until it reaches the business-app. To some organizations, scanning several barcodes and reviewing the data only _after_ it reaches the business-app can be inefficient, especially if the information isn't what they were looking for in the first place. This could lead to re-scans and additional worker overhead in order to capture the proper data

Normally, whenever a user launches the scanner, aims their camera at one or more barcodes, and captures the barcode data, Knox Capture simply passes the barcode information back to the business-app for review for the user to review. There is no way for the user to interact with any of the information until it reaches the business-app. To some organizations, scanning several barcodes and reviewing the data only _after_ it reaches the business-app can be inefficient, especially if the information isn't what they were looking for in the first place. This could lead to re-scans and additional worker overhead in order to capture the proper data. When a user triggers a barcode scan using Knox Capture AR, the camera preview window gets augmented with a customizable overlay that allows the user to view, analyze, and interact with the barcode data in real-time. For example, a retail worker using AR to scan an item could view information like the product's model number, sale price, or remaining inventory count, all from within the camera preview window, without ever having to open their business app to review the data. About AR templates Just like how scanning profiles define core Knox Capture behavior like which apps can trigger a scan, which barcodes are accepted, and what happens to data after it gets captured, AR templates also define the characteristics and behaviors of the Knox Capture AR feature. #Search-and-find templates This AR template provides an overlay to help users locate and isolate a single barcode when several similar barcodes are in the camera preview window. For example, a retail worker may be asked to locate a single box from a large wall of boxes in a warehouse. Using Knox Capture AR, the worker can start by scanning a reference barcode of the item they're searching for. After the reference barcode is scanned, the worker simply needs to point their camera at the wall of boxes in the warehouse. Knox Capture AR then analyzes each barcode in view, looking for a match. When a match is found, the AR overlay highlights the barcode, and additional product information is provided to the worker for review. #View-and-update templates This AR template provides an overlay to allow users to view product information and make real-time updates to a product database whenever a barcode is scanned. For example, a retail worker may want to know if there is enough inventory of a certain item before making a large-quantity transaction. Using Knox Capture AR, the worker can scan one of the items to bring up additional product information in the AR overlay. The worker can then see how many items are available in stock, and (after making the sale) immediately update their product database with a new stock count in real-time. See also , Refer to the Configure Knox Capture AR guide for instructions on creating Search-and-find and View-and-update AR templates as an IT admin. Refer to the Use Knox Capture AR guide for instructions on how to use AR templates to scan barcodes as an IT admin or end-user.",566

For customers who use Code 93 and Code 128 barcodes specifically, Knox Capture may have difficulties scanning barcodes that are too small. It is recommended that customers avoid using tiny barcodes whenver possible to increase the success rate of scans

Configure scan engine settings. Scan engine settings define the core Knox Capture behavior, such as how barcodes are scanned, and what happens with the data after each scan. The following settings are available: Barcode types Choose the barcode symbologies the scanner should recognize. For example, Code 39, and QR code. Available barcode types: Type , Options - , - Numeric-only (1D) , Codabar, EAN13, EAN8, Interleaved 2 of 5, UPCA, UPCE Alphanumeric (1D) , Code 128, Code 39, Code 93 2D , Data Matrix, PDF417, QR Every barcode except Codabar and Code 93 is enabled by default. Scanning settings Use scan settings to define how barcodes are scanned, selected, and parsed before Knox Capture sends them to a target business application. #Scan mode Sets the primary capture mode for scanning. Available options: Setting , Option - , - Single scan (default) , Scans and parses one barcode at a time. Multi scan , Detects multiple barcodes in the scan area at the same time

Out-of-range barcode still scanned successfully by Knox Capture. Overview For example, assuming you've set a symbol count range of 7 - 20 for Code 128 barcodes, the following situations may occur: Code ""1234567"" (length 7) can be successfully scanned. Code ""12345678"" (length 8) can be successfully scanned. Code ""123456"" (length 6) can't be successfully scanned. Code ""12345"" (length 5) can be successfully scanned. This is unexpected behavior. Code ""1234"" (length 4) can't be successfully scanned. Cause When setting the scan length, there's a difference between the number of digits or characters and the active symbol count. The correlation between characters and symbol counts depends on the encoding standard. For instance, Code 128 differs from Code 39. For Code 128, there are three different encoding schemes that can be mixed within a single Code 128 barcode to achieve the shortest possible code. Resolution Check which encoding standards your barcode data follows.

Overview. Get started with the basics by learning what Knox Capture is and how it works. What is Knox Capture? To help explain what Knox Capture does, it may be helpful to start with an understanding of what a *wedge* scanner is, and how it relates to the Knox Capture solution. In traditional hardware-based barcode scanning terminology, a wedge scanner is a physical device that attaches between a keyboard and a computer. The keyboard attaches to the scanner, and the scanner attaches to the computer. From the computer's perspective, the scanner behaves just like an additional keyboard. When the computer runs a software program (like an inventory spreadsheet app), and barcodes are read using the wedge scanner, data is sent from the scanner to the program in the form of keystrokes. From the program's point of view, data appears exactly as if someone had typed it manually using a keyboard. How Knox Capture works In a similar way, Knox Capture also acts as a wedge between a software program and keyboard

From the program's point of view, data appears exactly as if someone had typed it manually using a keyboard. How Knox Capture works In a similar way, Knox Capture also acts as a wedge between a software program and keyboard. However, instead of being a physical scanning device, Knox Capture is a mobile solution built for compatible Android smartphones and tablets. Enterprise IT admins can either download the Knox Capture app from Google Play, or custom-build their own wedge scanner apps using the Knox Capture SDK (Software Development Kit). Once Knox Capture is installed and running on a device, it *wedges* between an application (for example, a business app used to track inventory) and the mobile device's on-screen keyboard. When an end-user launches their business app, they can simply tap an on-screen button or press a hardware button on their device to trigger a barcode scan using the device's camera. After the camera focuses on a barcode, Knox Capture translates the barcode data into keystrokes, which then get passed back to the business app for processing. From the business app's point of view, keystrokes coming from Knox Capture appear exactly as if a user had typed them from the device keyboard. Who can use Knox Capture? Knox Capture is designed for anyone who wants to turn their mobile device into a powerful barcode scanner. However, depending on whether it's being used by an admin or an end-user, its features vary significantly. #Admin mode (Default) When Knox Capture is downloaded from Google Play and installed on a compatible Android device - and a valid license key is activated - the app operates in its default Admin mode. This mode allows the device user - typically an enterprise IT admin - to utilize the full functionality of the app to primarily do the following: 1. Create scanning profiles that define which apps can launch the barcode scanner, which barcode types can be scanned (QR, Code 128, EAN8, etc.), and how scanned data is formatted (append Tab or Enter key, insert special characters before or after data, etc.). 2. Test scanning profiles to ensure that appropriate business apps can launch the scanner and receive data back as keystrokes. 3. Export profile settings as a configuration file, which can then be used by EMM/UEM administrators to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to end-user devices. #Managed mode After an IT admin uses their EMM/UEM to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to an end-user's device, the device launches the app in Managed mode. In Managed mode, Knox Capture functionality is greatly reduced. End-users can review their scanning profile settings and perform barcode scans using their business apps (as permitted by their scanning profile), however they can't make changes to their scanning profiles, export profile settings, or switch to Admin mode by activating a Knox Capture license. Admin mode is the default mode of operation for Knox Capture. The procedures described in this guide are targeted at an IT admin audience. Further reading #Getting started tutorials These tutorials provide a guided workflow for new admins and end-users. While they don't cover every setting or scenario when using Knox Capture, they do provide a good starting point for learning the app's basics

Scanning profiles. Knox Capture acts as a wedge by translating barcode data into keystrokes that can be sent to a business application. But how does Knox Capture know what barcode types to scan, how to interpret scanned data, and which business applications to pass the data to? For Knox Capture, the *Scanning profile* defines the app's core behavior. A Scanning Profile is a configuration file that gets created or modified by an IT admin using the Knox Capture application. The profile defines how Knox Capture performs a barcode scan, and primarily consists of the following parameters: 1. Apps and activities - define which applications that can launch the Knox Capture scanner. 2. Scanner engine settings - specifying the barcode technologies (QR, Code 128, UPCA, etc.), scanning methods (single barcode, multi barcode), and camera behavior (enable flash, allow camera zoom). 3

Keystroke output data sent to browser or web app instead of business app. Overview Certain company-owned devices with a work profile might encounter an issue where barcode data sent through keystroke output is delivered to a browser or web app instead of the business app. Cause With recent improvements to company-owned devices with a work profile, a change was made to the way web apps - apps delivered through the browser instead of natively on Android - handle text view focus after scanning. On devices running Android 10 and lower, the text view is already in focus when scanned data returns to the business app. This focus behavior is no longer required with company-owned devices with a work profile running Android 11 and higher. Resolution To handle this change, you must enable the Allow remote control policy in your EMM to allow Knox Capture to restore focus to the text view. You only need to enable this policy if you've activated a Knox Platform for Enterprise Premium license.

Scanning overlay doesn't appear when launching the camera. Overview Some device users experience an issue where they are unable to view the scanner overlay after launching the device's camera for use as a scanner. Cause The issue occurs when the Android Enterprise policy that controls the DISALLOW_CREATE_WINDOWS boolean sets it to true. This boolean specifies whether or not apps can open secondary windows. By default, the value of this boolean is false, allowing apps like Knox Capture to create a window for the scanner overlay every time the camera launches. If a device policy sets this boolean to true, then Knox Capture won't be able to create the scanner overlay window when the camera launches. Resolution Ensure that the policy in your UEM profile that controls this value sets it to the equivalent of false. For Knox Manage customers, set the Create Window policy to Allow. For all other UEMs, refer to their documentation on Android Enterprise policies.",348

Scan data is only partially sent to business app. Overview When sending longer barcode data as keystrokes from Knox Capture to a business app, only part of the data can be seen in the business app. Pre-condition This article assumes that the following conditions are met in your Knox Capture scanning profile: 1. Continuous scanning is enabled. This setting is disabled by default. 2. Keystroke output is configured to send scan data as Key events. By default, this value is set to String. Cause When Keystroke data is configured to send as a key event (rather than a string), the processing time is increased. After an internal timer counts down to zero, Knox Capture assumes that all scanned data was delivered successfully to the target field in the business app, and switches the focus back to the scanner overlay. The remaining undelivered data is then sent to the scanner overlay instead of the business app

. The remaining undelivered data is then sent to the scanner overlay instead of the business app. Resolution In the Knox Capture profile settings, navigate to Keystroke output > Set key event delay and extend the length of time before the foreground focus switches back to the scanner overlay. By default, the key event delay is set to 0 ms. The delay you set occurs between individual key events sent to the business app. For example, when sending scan data that's 10 characters long with a 50 ms key event delay, a 500 ms total delay can be observed.

AR overview. The Knox Capture AR (Augmented Reality) is a feature that allows users to view important, business-critical information on the device screen when peforming a barcode scan. Normally, whenever a user launches the scanner, aims their camera at one or more barcodes, and captures the barcode data, Knox Capture simply passes the barcode information back to the business-app for review for the user to review. There is no way for the user to interact with any of the information until it reaches the business-app. To some organizations, scanning several barcodes and reviewing the data only _after_ it reaches the business-app can be inefficient, especially if the information isn't what they were looking for in the first place. This could lead to re-scans and additional worker overhead in order to capture the proper data. When a user triggers a barcode scan using Knox Capture AR, the camera preview window gets augmented with a customizable overlay that allows the user to view, analyze, and interact with the barcode data in real-time. For example, a retail worker using AR to scan an item could view information like the product's model number, sale price, or remaining inventory count, all from within the camera preview window, without ever having to open their business app to review the data. About AR templates Just like how scanning profiles define core Knox Capture behavior like which apps can trigger a scan, which barcodes are accepted, and what happens to data after it gets captured, AR templates also define the characteristics and behaviors of the Knox Capture AR feature. #Search-and-find templates This AR template provides an overlay to help users locate and isolate a single barcode when several similar barcodes are in the camera preview window. For example, a retail worker may be asked to locate a single box from a large wall of boxes in a warehouse. Using Knox Capture AR, the worker can start by scanning a reference barcode of the item they're searching for. After the reference barcode is scanned, the worker simply needs to point their camera at the wall of boxes in the warehouse. Knox Capture AR then analyzes each barcode in view, looking for a match. When a match is found, the AR overlay highlights the barcode, and additional product information is provided to the worker for review. #View-and-update templates This AR template provides an overlay to allow users to view product information and make real-time updates to a product database whenever a barcode is scanned. For example, a retail worker may want to know if there is enough inventory of a certain item before making a large-quantity transaction. Using Knox Capture AR, the worker can scan one of the items to bring up additional product information in the AR overlay. The worker can then see how many items are available in stock, and (after making the sale) immediately update their product database with a new stock count in real-time. See also , Refer to the Configure Knox Capture AR guide for instructions on creating Search-and-find and View-and-update AR templates as an IT admin. Refer to the Use Knox Capture AR guide for instructions on how to use AR templates to scan barcodes as an IT admin or end-user.

How do I know if this app is right for my enterprise? . Knox Capture supports a variety of use cases, and works best when paired with an EMM for deployment, configuration, and license activation. A dedicated app manager, like an IT admin, is required to configure Knox Capture for business apps.",456

What does a wedge scanner traditionally do in terms of connecting a keyboard to a computer?,"In traditional hardware-based barcode scanning terminology, a wedge scanner is a physical device that attaches between a keyboard and a computer, behaving just like an additional keyboard."," A traditional wedge scanner is a physical device that attaches between a keyboard and a computer.

Get started with the basics by learning what Knox Capture is and how it works. What is Knox Capture? To help explain what Knox Capture does, it may be helpful to start with an understanding of what a *wedge* scanner is, and how it relates to the Knox Capture solution. In traditional hardware-based barcode scanning terminology, a wedge scanner is a physical device that attaches between a keyboard and a computer. The keyboard attaches to the scanner, and the scanner attaches to the computer. From the computer's perspective, the scanner behaves just like an additional keyboard. When the computer runs a software program (like an inventory spreadsheet app), and barcodes are read using the wedge scanner, data is sent from the scanner to the program in the form of keystrokes. From the program's point of view, data appears exactly as if someone had typed it manually using a keyboard. How Knox Capture works In a similar way, Knox Capture also acts as a wedge between a software program and keyboard

Why is Knox Capture called a wedge? . A wedge barcode scanner is a physical device that attaches to a keyboard or a computer. It reads barcode data and translates it to a string that is then input into the system, as if a user had manually typed the string using the keyboard. In the same way, Knox Capture acts as middleware that reads barcode data captured by the XCover Pro device, translates it into a string, formats the string, and then sends it to a third-party business app that understands the resulting data. Knox Capture takes care of integrating with your business app, so that you don't have to build barcode scanning logic into your business app using a software development kit (SDK). So how does Knox Capture know which barcodes to read, how to format the data, and which business app to send the data to? The IT admin defines those details in a profile in Knox Capture. Once the IT admin has configured the profile, they push it to enterprise devices through their EMM. Device users can then start using the business app to scan barcodes.

Overview. Get started with the basics by learning what Knox Capture is and how it works. What is Knox Capture?

From the program's point of view, data appears exactly as if someone had typed it manually using a keyboard. How Knox Capture works In a similar way, Knox Capture also acts as a wedge between a software program and keyboard. However, instead of being a physical scanning device, Knox Capture is a mobile solution built for compatible Android smartphones and tablets. Enterprise IT admins can either download the Knox Capture app from Google Play, or custom-build their own wedge scanner apps using the Knox Capture SDK (Software Development Kit). Once Knox Capture is installed and running on a device, it *wedges* between an application (for example, a business app used to track inventory) and the mobile device's on-screen keyboard. When an end-user launches their business app, they can simply tap an on-screen button or press a hardware button on their device to trigger a barcode scan using the device's camera. After the camera focuses on a barcode, Knox Capture translates the barcode data into keystrokes, which then get passed back to the business app for processing. From the business app's point of view, keystrokes coming from Knox Capture appear exactly as if a user had typed them from the device keyboard. Who can use Knox Capture? Knox Capture is designed for anyone who wants to turn their mobile device into a powerful barcode scanner. However, depending on whether it's being used by an admin or an end-user, its features vary significantly. #Admin mode (Default) When Knox Capture is downloaded from Google Play and installed on a compatible Android device - and a valid license key is activated - the app operates in its default Admin mode. This mode allows the device user - typically an enterprise IT admin - to utilize the full functionality of the app to primarily do the following: 1. Create scanning profiles that define which apps can launch the barcode scanner, which barcode types can be scanned (QR, Code 128, EAN8, etc.), and how scanned data is formatted (append Tab or Enter key, insert special characters before or after data, etc.). 2. Test scanning profiles to ensure that appropriate business apps can launch the scanner and receive data back as keystrokes. 3. Export profile settings as a configuration file, which can then be used by EMM/UEM administrators to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to end-user devices. #Managed mode After an IT admin uses their EMM/UEM to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to an end-user's device, the device launches the app in Managed mode. In Managed mode, Knox Capture functionality is greatly reduced. End-users can review their scanning profile settings and perform barcode scans using their business apps (as permitted by their scanning profile), however they can't make changes to their scanning profiles, export profile settings, or switch to Admin mode by activating a Knox Capture license. Admin mode is the default mode of operation for Knox Capture. The procedures described in this guide are targeted at an IT admin audience. Further reading #Getting started tutorials These tutorials provide a guided workflow for new admins and end-users. While they don't cover every setting or scenario when using Knox Capture, they do provide a good starting point for learning the app's basics

Configure output path. Knox Capture can send scanned data to a Bluetooth-enabled device, like a PC, as a Human Interface Device (HID) keyboard, emulating the functionality of a hardware scanner. This feature is ideal for high-security enterprises with wireless network restrictions. For example, you might want to keep track of which assets are checked in or out of a restricted facility. In that case, you can use Knox Capture to scan an asset tag and send its data directly to a PC through Bluetooth. How it works The following describes how connected devices and scanned data are handled when using Knox Capture's Bluetooth wedge functionality: If the device is connected to a PC, output data is entered at the location of the keyboard cursor. Knox Capture applies any basic and advanced data formatting rules set in the default scanning profile to the output data. Only one Bluetooth-enabled device can be connected at a time. To connect to another device, you must first disconnect the current one",265

Updated toast message behavior after Knox Capture scan trigge Previously, when a device user tried to initiate a Knox Capture scan with a hardware or software trigger and there was no Knox Capture profile associated with the app activity, the following toast message appeared: [Package name] doesn't support Knox Capture scan This message appeared most frequently in system apps. Starting from v1.3, Knox Capture supports scanning for all system apps. If there is no Knox Capture profile for the app activity, the toast message no longer appears after the device user activates one of the Knox Capture trigger buttons. This behavior applies to both the device camera and any peripheral hardware scanners attached to the device. Support for system apps in scanning profile creation Prior to Knox Capture v1.3, only 3 system apps were allowlisted when selecting apps for scanning profile creation: Samsung Internet, Google Chrome, and Samsung Messages. With this release, you can now select system apps in addition to downloaded apps when creating a profile. On the app selection screen, tap the filter icon and choose to filter the app list by Downloaded apps, System apps, or All. !System apps menu Scanning engine improvements Knox Capture v1.3 adds the following scanning engine and performance enhancements: 1D barcodes with 1px bars are now recognized more easily.

Knox Capture v1.8 release notes. New features Knox Capture v1.8 introduces the following new features: #Continuous single scan A new Continuous scanning option appears on the Scan engine settings > Single scan preferences screen. When this option is toggled On, device users can scan several barcodes in sequence - and have each scan be registered as a single event - without having to press the camera trigger button between each scan. To learn more about the Continuous scanning feature, see Single scan preferences. #Scanner overlay In this release, device users have the option to view the camera preview window as an overlay on top of their business app. When the Scanner overlay feature is enabled and a scan is triggered, users will see a mini camera preview window on top of their existing business app screen. To learn more about this new feature, see Scanner overlay. #Inverse color barcode support This release adds a new Performance lab feature that allows users to scan inverse colored barcodes. This feature only works with Data Matrix and QR type barcodes in this release. To enable this option, go to the Knox Capture main screen, then tap the Options button (three dots), tap Performance lab, then enable Inverted color recognition. Enhancements Knox Capture v1.8 includes the following enhancements to existing features: #More intuitive user prompts when connecting USB device Previously, users would get a prompt even if Knox Capture wasn't running in the foreground. For example, a user might want to connect a USB keyboard for use in their business. When connecting the keyboard, they would see a prompt asking if they wanted to use the USB keyboard for scanning purposes, even though they may not be using Knox Capture at the time. This release improves the prompt so that it only shows when Knox Capture is being used in the foreground. The device user must grant system permissions for connected devices in order for the prompt to display. If no permissions are granted, the prompt will not display on any screen. #Seamlessly switch between multiple paired devices in Output path If a user is paired with multiple devices in Knox Capture's Output path, they can now switch between each of their paired devices more easily. Previously, if a user had two paired devices in Output path, and Knox Capture was connected to _device A_, the user would first have to disconnect from _device A_ before connecting to _device B_. With this release, the user simply has to connect to _device B_. Knox Capture automatically disconnects from any previously paired devices. #Receive a notification when overlay is restricted by IT admin Some device users may experience an issue where they are unable to view the camera preview window after triggering a scan. This issue can be caused by a restriction set by the IT admin and the organization's UEM policy. Previously, if the restriction was set, the user would simply not be able to see the preview window. In this release, the user will now get a notification asking them to contact their IT admin for more information. To learn more about the restriction, see the Knox Capture Knowledge Base Article (KBA) related to this issue. Back to release notes",157

Scanning profiles. Knox Capture acts as a wedge by translating barcode data into keystrokes that can be sent to a business application. But how does Knox Capture know what barcode types to scan, how to interpret scanned data, and which business applications to pass the data to? For Knox Capture, the *Scanning profile* defines the app's core behavior. A Scanning Profile is a configuration file that gets created or modified by an IT admin using the Knox Capture application. The profile defines how Knox Capture performs a barcode scan, and primarily consists of the following parameters: 1. Apps and activities - define which applications that can launch the Knox Capture scanner. 2. Scanner engine settings - specifying the barcode technologies (QR, Code 128, UPCA, etc.), scanning methods (single barcode, multi barcode), and camera behavior (enable flash, allow camera zoom). 3. Keystroke output rules - specifying how barcode data gets converted into keystrokes (append Tab or Enter character to each barcode, add prefix or suffix characters, convert output to hex characters, etc.) Default scanning profile Out-of-the-box, Knox Capture includes a default scanning profile that gets automatically associated with all apps on the device. In other words, when Knox Capture is launched, *any* app can trigger the camera scanner and receive barcode data in the form of keystrokes. This makes it easy to use Knox Capture for basic scanning purposes without any additional setup. When using the default scanning profile, IT admins can change the profile's scan engine settings and data processing rules, however they cannot change the default profile's apps and activities behavior. For example, an IT admin can modify the default profile to append a Tab key at the end of each barcode, but they cannot change which apps can trigger the scanner. Custom scanning profiles While the default scanning profile allows Knox Capture to be used right away without any configuration, IT admins may want to use a custom profile to better suit their needs. With a custom profile, IT admins control which apps and activities can trigger a barcode scan. Any apps that you don't select in the custom profile will follow the default behavior in that the barcode scanner is active for all apps not specified in the custom profile. Creating custom scanning profiles Custom profiles can be created by modifying the default profile settings, or by creating entirely new profiles altogether. 1. Tap the + button near the top of the app UI to open the profile creation options. 2. Select Create profile to start a profile from scratch, or select Duplicate existing profile to copy the settings from an existing (custom or default) profile. Alternatively, you can create a custom profile by clicking Create profile without clicking the + button. 3. Provide a profile name, then tap Done. The new profile appears in the profiles area below Defult scanning profile.",632

Support for exporting large configurations through QR code !Multiple QR code export This Knox Capture version extends the QR code export functionality to support larger configurations. Prior to v1.2, IT admins couldn't select QR code as the export method if the configuration size was too large. Now, multiple QR codes are generated in a PDF file for the end user to scan. The device prompts the user to scan them all before the configuration can be successfully imported to Knox Capture. To learn more, see Export a scanning configuration and Import a scanning configuration. Persistent scan sessions IT admins and end users can now pick up calls, switch apps, and clear tasks during scan sessions without losing scanned data. Rebooting the device has no impact on saved scan data. In multi-scan sessions where the user leaves the business app and returns, they are prompted to either continue the original scan session or begin a new one

. Once the file has been shared, the receiving device can import the configuration by doing the following: Importing a configuration overrides existing Knox Capture settings on a device and is irreversible. 1. Tap the more actions menu icon within the home page to the right of the Profiles list label. Then select Import. 2. After launching the import configuration menu, acknowledge the warning message by tapping Confirm. 3. Find the configuration file to import. Knox Capture will import the configuration and display a success message: #Import with QR code If a configuration was shared via QR code, you can import the configuration by doing the following: 1. Tap the QR code icon within the import configuration menu to launch the camera scanner. 2. Direct the camera at the QR code. 3. After scanning the QR code, Knox Capture automatically imports the configuration and displays a success message. If the configuration is too large for one QR code, Knox Capture displays multiple QR codes in a PDF file. The end user must scan them all to complete the import process. If the user attempts to scan a QR code that isn't part of the same configuration, an error message is shown on the overlay until a different one is scanned.

. Scanned raw - The scanned barcode data in hexadecimal format without any keystroke output rules applied. 7. Inspect and compare the Scanned data to the Output data to ensure you've set the correct keystroke output rules. Repeat this test with other apps as required. 8. Exit test mode tapping X in the top-right corner of the test overlay, then in the confirmation pop-up, tap Close to return to the Test apps list. Step 6: Export configuration After editing your profiles, you can export the configuration as a .txt file. This configuration file can be shared with other Knox Capture IT admins, or it can be used in your EMM/UEM to deploy Knox Capture as a managed-app to end-users. To export a scanning configuration: 1. On the home screen, tap the Share button in the lower-right corner. 2. In the pop-up, seelct Email, then select your preferred email app. The configuration file is automatically attached. 3. After sending the email with the configuration file attached, re-launch Knox Capture. You should see a notification confirming the email submission followed by the date and time. Step 7: Deploy Knox Capture using an EMM/UEM You have now configured a basic Knox Capture configuration and exported it as an email attachment. The only thing left to do is use the configuration to deploy Knox Capture as a managed-app to your end-users. Actual deployment steps vary depending on the EMM provider, but they should generally resemble the following: 1. Add the Knox Capture app to your Managed Google Play Store. 2. Assign the app to a group or organization and launch the app configuration dialog. In a typical console, the app configuration dialog opens as a pop-up window or modal. 3. Activate the license by pasting it into the field within the app configuration (App Config) screen. 4. Copy and paste the exported configuration into the provided app configuration field. Adding a configuration to Managed Google Play is the only step necessary to ensure all devices installing the app operate in Managed mode. However, if you're using a trial version of Knox Capture, you'll need to push a Knox Suite license key as well. Refer to the following table for details on the configuration data: Configuration key , Configuration type , Configuration value - , - , - smartscan_license , String , Knox license key smartscan_config , String , Exported configuration data from Knox Capture 5. Save the updated settings and deploy. Summary You have now completed a typical Knox Capture workflow for IT admins, and have been introduced to configuring and deploying the app to managed devices.

There are several ways to add activities: 1. Add app activities all at once 2. Add individual activities visually 3. Add individual activities from the app activity list view To begin adding activities, either create a new profile or open an existing profile to edit and select a target app. When working with a custom business app, consider asking your team for a descriptive list of all the Android activities within the app, as this is a good way to find and associate activities quickly within Knox Capture. Add all activities at once To add apps as a single activity: 1. Tap the radio button to the left of the app name within the Select applications list. 2. An app can also be selected by tapping its name, then tapping the All button at the upper-left of the app activities list. Add individual activities visually To add individual apps visually: 1

Configure apps and activities. Each Knox Capture profile supports a set of apps to which its scanner and keystroke output settings apply. IT admins can set more refined control over each scanning context within an app by associating individual Android activities with different Knox Capture profiles. A user interacts with an Android activity within an app's UI, such as a user data form or search input. Refer to the Android developer documentation for more information about activities. Depending on deployment requirements, consider configuring one profile for all apps. Or, set up a unique profile for each device app. Or, associate a group of apps or activities with one profile. For example, within the *same* app, consider associating: A user data form with one profile that appends a Tab key event to scanned data, A search input field with a profile that appends an Enter key event A single profile can have numerous apps or activities, but a single activity can only belong to one profile.

. When using the default scanning profile, IT admins can change the profile's scan engine settings and data processing rules, however they cannot change the default profile's apps and activities behavior. For example, an IT admin can modify the default profile to append a Tab key at the end of each barcode, but they cannot change which apps can trigger the scanner. Custom scanning profiles While the default scanning profile allows Knox Capture to be used right away without any configuration, IT admins may want to use a custom profile to better suit their needs. With a custom profile, IT admins control which apps and activities can trigger a barcode scan. Any apps that you don't select in the custom profile will follow the default behavior in that the barcode scanner is active for all apps not specified in the custom profile. Creating custom scanning profiles Custom profiles can be created by modifying the default profile settings, or by creating entirely new profiles altogether. 1

Configure output path. Knox Capture can send scanned data to a Bluetooth-enabled device, like a PC, as a Human Interface Device (HID) keyboard, emulating the functionality of a hardware scanner. This feature is ideal for high-security enterprises with wireless network restrictions. For example, you might want to keep track of which assets are checked in or out of a restricted facility. In that case, you can use Knox Capture to scan an asset tag and send its data directly to a PC through Bluetooth. How it works The following describes how connected devices and scanned data are handled when using Knox Capture's Bluetooth wedge functionality: If the device is connected to a PC, output data is entered at the location of the keyboard cursor. Knox Capture applies any basic and advanced data formatting rules set in the default scanning profile to the output data. Only one Bluetooth-enabled device can be connected at a time. To connect to another device, you must first disconnect the current one. Scanning profiles are not supported, as Knox Capture operates as an HID keyboard. Connect a device To connect your device to a PC or other Bluetooth-enabled device using Knox Capture: 1. On the home screen, next to Profiles, tap the more actions menu icon. 2. Select Output path. 3. Under Bluetooth, toggle Use bluetooth wedge to the on position. 4. Under Paired devices, tap Make this device discoverable. To avoid unexpected scanning or output behavior, ensure you use Make this device discoverable instead of the Bluetooth menu in the device's settings. 5. If Bluetooth is disabled on your device, you're prompted to enable it. Then, Knox Capture asks for permission to make your device visible to others. Tap Allow. 6. Select a device to pair with. A status message confirms that the two devices are connected. A notification will alert you that the HID service is running. Any scanned data is then sent to the paired device through Bluetooth. Unpair a device To unpair a device through Knox Capture: 1. On the home screen, next to Profiles, tap the three dots. 2. Select Output path. 3. Under Paired devices, tap the gear next to the device you want to unpair. The device will be unpaired and removed from the Paired devices list.

. When connecting the keyboard, they would see a prompt asking if they wanted to use the USB keyboard for scanning purposes, even though they may not be using Knox Capture at the time. This release improves the prompt so that it only shows when Knox Capture is being used in the foreground. The device user must grant system permissions for connected devices in order for the prompt to display. If no permissions are granted, the prompt will not display on any screen. #Seamlessly switch between multiple paired devices in Output path If a user is paired with multiple devices in Knox Capture's Output path, they can now switch between each of their paired devices more easily. Previously, if a user had two paired devices in Output path, and Knox Capture was connected to _device A_, the user would first have to disconnect from _device A_ before connecting to _device B_. With this release, the user simply has to connect to _device B_. Knox Capture automatically disconnects from any previously paired devices

. To remove a Bluetooth scanner, tap the gear icon next to the scanner and select Remove as a scanner. If you don't want to see the scan confirmation pop-up from Knox Capture again, select Unpair instead. For USB scanners 1. Launch the Knox Capture application, then simply plug in your USB scanner. 2. When the New Device Connected pop-up displays, tap Yes to allow your device to connect to the scanner. You'll be automatically taken to the Connect scanner screen. If you close the pop-up without confirming, you must disconnect and reconnect the scanner before you can use it with Knox Capture. 3. To remove a paired USB scanner, on the Connect scanner screen, go to Connected devices, then tap the gear icon next to the scanner and select Remove as a scanner. Test a scanner You can also test your scanner in Test mode. If any app has the Hardware scanner setting enabled, the Test apps screen shows your connected scanners under the apps",149

. #View-and-update templates This AR template provides an overlay to allow users to view product information and make real-time updates to a product database whenever a barcode is scanned. For example, a retail worker may want to know if there is enough inventory of a certain item before making a large-quantity transaction. Using Knox Capture AR, the worker can scan one of the items to bring up additional product information in the AR overlay. The worker can then see how many items are available in stock, and (after making the sale) immediately update their product database with a new stock count in real-time. See also , Refer to the Configure Knox Capture AR guide for instructions on creating Search-and-find and View-and-update AR templates as an IT admin. Refer to the Use Knox Capture AR guide for instructions on how to use AR templates to scan barcodes as an IT admin or end-user.

. #Search-and-find templates This AR template provides an overlay to help users locate and isolate a single barcode when several similar barcodes are in the camera preview window. For example, a retail worker may be asked to locate a single box from a large wall of boxes in a warehouse. Using Knox Capture AR, the worker can start by scanning a reference barcode of the item they're searching for. After the reference barcode is scanned, the worker simply needs to point their camera at the wall of boxes in the warehouse. Knox Capture AR then analyzes each barcode in view, looking for a match. When a match is found, the AR overlay highlights the barcode, and additional product information is provided to the worker for review. #View-and-update templates This AR template provides an overlay to allow users to view product information and make real-time updates to a product database whenever a barcode is scanned

In both cases, you can drag and drop the button to change its position. If a device was upgraded to OneUI 2.5 or above after installing Knox Capture, the scan button remains in the same position on the keyboard as it was before the upgrade. Pinch-to-zoom gestures for scanning When scanning barcodes using Knox Capture, users can now use pinch gestures to increase or decrease the scan range up to a maximum of 4x resolution. In single-scan mode, the capture screen resets to the original zoom factor after each scan. In multi-scan mode, the screen remains zoomed in or out for the remainder of the scan session. Intent output Knox Capture v1.1 adds support for intent output. As an IT admin, you can configure scan data to be sent programmatically to a business app when triggered by an Android intent. Upon scanning, the app acquires the data and can either consume or process it further. Refer to Intent output for more details. WP-C mode support Knox Capture is now compatible with work profile on company owned devices (WP-C), which is replacing fully managed devices with a work profile in Android 11. In WP-C mode, Knox Capture supports business apps installed in the same device area - for example, if both Knox Capture and the business app are inside the work profile. Nearby Share support Starting from Android 10, NFC is deprecated and replaced with Nearby Share to enhance user privacy.

How can an administrator configure the default profile setting so that it does not override application-specific configurations created for Knox Capture?,"To change the default profile setting, an administrator must go to Knox Capture’s main page and set the default profile to “Off.” This configuration cannot be changed in Managed mode."," First, the relevant context:

""If you create profiles for several applications and don't want the default profile's behavior to override any configurations, set the default profile to Off.""

So to prevent the default profile from overriding application-specific configurations in Knox Capture, an administrator can set the default profile to Off.",1,1,6,1.0,0.9969694018363953,0.0,0,18.08337092399597,". If you create profiles for several applications and don't want the default profile's behavior to override any configurations, set the default profile to Off. The default profile setting is available on the Knox Capture main page. You can change the configuration at any time, export and deploy it to end users in Managed mode. If a profile is not active for an app or foreground activity and the end user attempts to scan a barcode, an error message is shown stating that the application does not support Knox Capture scanning. This setting cannot be changed in Managed mode. New floating button scan trigger !Hardware scan trigger setting !Hardware scan trigger setting A floating scan button is now available that launches the Knox Capture camera for scanning. By default, the scan button appears in the bottom right corner of the device's screen. Users can move it around the screen, and it remains in the last known position until it's toggled off. The scan button can be used in both Admin and Managed modes

. When using the default scanning profile, IT admins can change the profile's scan engine settings and data processing rules, however they cannot change the default profile's apps and activities behavior. For example, an IT admin can modify the default profile to append a Tab key at the end of each barcode, but they cannot change which apps can trigger the scanner. Custom scanning profiles While the default scanning profile allows Knox Capture to be used right away without any configuration, IT admins may want to use a custom profile to better suit their needs. With a custom profile, IT admins control which apps and activities can trigger a barcode scan. Any apps that you don't select in the custom profile will follow the default behavior in that the barcode scanner is active for all apps not specified in the custom profile. Creating custom scanning profiles Custom profiles can be created by modifying the default profile settings, or by creating entirely new profiles altogether. 1

. 3. Export profile settings as a configuration file, which can then be used by EMM/UEM administrators to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to end-user devices. #Managed mode After an IT admin uses their EMM/UEM to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to an end-user's device, the device launches the app in Managed mode. In Managed mode, Knox Capture functionality is greatly reduced. End-users can review their scanning profile settings and perform barcode scans using their business apps (as permitted by their scanning profile), however they can't make changes to their scanning profiles, export profile settings, or switch to Admin mode by activating a Knox Capture license. Admin mode is the default mode of operation for Knox Capture. The procedures described in this guide are targeted at an IT admin audience.

Scanning profiles. Knox Capture acts as a wedge by translating barcode data into keystrokes that can be sent to a business application. But how does Knox Capture know what barcode types to scan, how to interpret scanned data, and which business applications to pass the data to? For Knox Capture, the *Scanning profile* defines the app's core behavior. A Scanning Profile is a configuration file that gets created or modified by an IT admin using the Knox Capture application. The profile defines how Knox Capture performs a barcode scan, and primarily consists of the following parameters: 1. Apps and activities - define which applications that can launch the Knox Capture scanner. 2. Scanner engine settings - specifying the barcode technologies (QR, Code 128, UPCA, etc.), scanning methods (single barcode, multi barcode), and camera behavior (enable flash, allow camera zoom). 3

Keystroke output rules - specifying how barcode data gets converted into keystrokes (append Tab or Enter character to each barcode, add prefix or suffix characters, convert output to hex characters, etc.) Default scanning profile Out-of-the-box, Knox Capture includes a default scanning profile that gets automatically associated with all apps on the device. In other words, when Knox Capture is launched, *any* app can trigger the camera scanner and receive barcode data in the form of keystrokes. This makes it easy to use Knox Capture for basic scanning purposes without any additional setup. When using the default scanning profile, IT admins can change the profile's scan engine settings and data processing rules, however they cannot change the default profile's apps and activities behavior. For example, an IT admin can modify the default profile to append a Tab key at the end of each barcode, but they cannot change which apps can trigger the scanner.

Keyboard scan button input method A scan button has been added to the device keyboard that launches the Knox Capture camera for scanning. On devices running OneUI 2.1, the scan button is added to the last position on the keyboard toolbar. On devices with OneUI 2.5 and above, installing Knox Capture adds the scan button to the first position on the keyboard toolbar by default. In both cases, you can drag and drop the button to change its position. If a device was upgraded to OneUI 2.5 or above after installing Knox Capture, the scan button remains in the same position on the keyboard as it was before the upgrade. Pinch-to-zoom gestures for scanning When scanning barcodes using Knox Capture, users can now use pinch gestures to increase or decrease the scan range up to a maximum of 4x resolution. In single-scan mode, the capture screen resets to the original zoom factor after each scan. In multi-scan mode, the screen remains zoomed in or out for the remainder of the scan session. Intent output Knox Capture v1.1 adds support for intent output. As an IT admin, you can configure scan data to be sent programmatically to a business app when triggered by an Android intent. Upon scanning, the app acquires the data and can either consume or process it further. Refer to Intent output for more details. WP-C mode support Knox Capture is now compatible with work profile on company owned devices (WP-C), which is replacing fully managed devices with a work profile in Android 11. In WP-C mode, Knox Capture supports business apps installed in the same device area - for example, if both Knox Capture and the business app are inside the work profile. Nearby Share support Starting from Android 10, NFC is deprecated and replaced with Nearby Share to enhance user privacy. Knox Capture v1.1 supports importing and exporting profile configurations using Nearby Share, allowing you to quickly share configurations with devices in your proximity. Back to release notes",329
Can you explain the updates included in the Scandit library in Knox Capture v1.6 and how they improve 1D code highlighting accuracy?,"In Knox Capture v1.6, the Scandit library was updated to version 6.12, which improves the accuracy of 1D code highlighting whenever glare is present on the barcode. The update helps the software to better recognize and decode codes, even when they are difficult to read because of external lighting or other distractions.","

Knox Capture v1.6 includes updates to the Scandit library, which improves on 1D code highlighting accuracy whenever glare is present on the barcode. Specifically, it enhances the ability to highlight and read 1D barcodes when there is glare on the barcode that would normally make it difficult to scan successfully. This allows users to more reliably scan 1D barcodes even in suboptimal lighting conditions where glare may be an issue.",1,1,6,1.0,0.9999271631240845,1.0,0,16.098681449890137,"Knox Capture v1.6 release notes.

Knox Capture v1.5 release notes. Scanner overlay Starting with Knox Capture v1.5, a scanner overlay is available. This overlay appears as a scanner preview over business apps, and enables device users to immediately see scanned data entered into an app field. Functionally, the scanner overlay works much like the full-screen scanner. When the device user aims the camera at the barcode, Knox Capture then sends the scanned data to the business app depending on whether single scan or multi-scan mode is enabled, and how Barcode selection is configured. See Use the scanner overlay to learn more. Continuous scanning for single scan mode Previously, when device users scanned single barcodes, the camera preview turned on before each scan, then off again once the scan was completed. Now, in Single scan preferences, you can turn on Continuous scanning to scan back-to-back barcodes without relaunching the camera preview after every scan. This feature maximizes worker efficiency when used with a Bluetooth wedge or the scanner overlay. Improvements to configuration behavior after profile mode change With this release, if a Knox Capture profile is pushed to a device in Admin mode through a UEM, the device enters Managed mode and removes any configurations previously applied in Admin mode. For example, consider a device user who's conducting practice scans in Admin mode. Upon receiving a profile configuration, a notification on the device confirms that the configuration updated, and Knox Capture automatically turns off test mode and clears the test results. PDF417 barcode support for default profiles Starting with Knox Capture v1.5, default profiles now include the PDF417 barcode type. The current barcode symbologies enabled in the default profile are: Code 128, QR, Code 39, EAN8, EAN13/UPCA, UPCE, Interleaved 2 of 5, Data Matrix, PDF417 Back to release notes",437

What policy setting prevents the scanner overlay from appearing when launching the camera app?,The UEM policy controlling the DISALLOW_CREATE_WINDOWS boolean.," The key policy setting that prevents the scanner overlay from appearing is:

The DISALLOW_CREATE_WINDOWS boolean policy. When set to true, this prevents Knox Capture from creating the secondary window needed for the scanner overlay. By default this policy is false, allowing the creation of secondary windows. So if a device policy sets this to true, it blocks the scanner overlay from appearing when launching the camera.",1,1,6,1.0,0.8415161371231079,1.0,0,4.71746563911438,"Scanning overlay doesn't appear when launching the camera. Overview Some device users experience an issue where they are unable to view the scanner overlay after launching the device's camera for use as a scanner. Cause The issue occurs when the Android Enterprise policy that controls the DISALLOW_CREATE_WINDOWS boolean sets it to true. This boolean specifies whether or not apps can open secondary windows. By default, the value of this boolean is false, allowing apps like Knox Capture to create a window for the scanner overlay every time the camera launches. If a device policy sets this boolean to true, then Knox Capture won't be able to create the scanner overlay window when the camera launches. Resolution Ensure that the policy in your UEM profile that controls this value sets it to the equivalent of false. For Knox Manage customers, set the Create Window policy to Allow. For all other UEMs, refer to their documentation on Android Enterprise policies.

Use scanner overlay. The Scanner overlay feature lets device users view the camera preview window and the business app screen concurrently. When the user triggers a barcode scan, a mini camera preview is shown over the business app screen as a picture-in-picture (PiP) window, allowing users to use the scanner and view their app's data at the same time. Functionally, the Scanner overlay behaves just like the normal scanner. When the device user aims the camera at the barcode, Knox Capture sends the scanned data to the business app depending on how the scan engine settings are configured. Enable the Scanner overlay The Scanner overlay can be enabled in both Admin and Managed modes. To enable this feature, go to the Knox Capture home screen, tap the Options button (three dots), tap Scanner overlay, then toggle the feature On.

What is the unexpected behavior that occurs with out-of-range barcodes in Knox Capture?,"Out-of-range barcodes can still be successfully scanned by Knox Capture, which is unexpected behavior. This occurs when the scan length is set and there are differences between the number of digits or characters and the active symbol count."," The unexpected behavior that occurs with out-of-range barcodes in Knox Capture is that barcodes shorter than the minimum range configured in Knox Capture can still be successfully scanned. Specifically, the context states:

""For example, assuming you've set a symbol count range of 7 - 20 for Code 128 barcodes, the following situations may occur:
Code ""1234567"" (length 7) can be successfully scanned. 
Code ""12345678"" (length 8) can be successfully scanned.
Code ""123456"" (length 6) can't be successfully scanned.
Code ""12345"" (length 5) can be successfully scanned. This is unexpected behavior.""

So barcodes shorter than the minimum range, such as ""12345"", can still be scanned successfully even though they are out of range. This is unexpected behavior.",1,1,6,1.0,0.9998863935470581,1.0,0,11.037903070449829,"Out-of-range barcode still scanned successfully by Knox Capture. Overview For example, assuming you've set a symbol count range of 7 - 20 for Code 128 barcodes, the following situations may occur: Code ""1234567"" (length 7) can be successfully scanned. Code ""12345678"" (length 8) can be successfully scanned. Code ""123456"" (length 6) can't be successfully scanned. Code ""12345"" (length 5) can be successfully scanned. This is unexpected behavior. Code ""1234"" (length 4) can't be successfully scanned. Cause When setting the scan length, there's a difference between the number of digits or characters and the active symbol count. The correlation between characters and symbol counts depends on the encoding standard. For instance, Code 128 differs from Code 39. For Code 128, there are three different encoding schemes that can be mixed within a single Code 128 barcode to achieve the shortest possible code. Resolution Check which encoding standards your barcode data follows.

Scan data is only partially sent to business app. Overview When sending longer barcode data as keystrokes from Knox Capture to a business app, only part of the data can be seen in the business app. Pre-condition This article assumes that the following conditions are met in your Knox Capture scanning profile: 1. Continuous scanning is enabled. This setting is disabled by default. 2. Keystroke output is configured to send scan data as Key events. By default, this value is set to String. Cause When Keystroke data is configured to send as a key event (rather than a string), the processing time is increased. After an internal timer counts down to zero, Knox Capture assumes that all scanned data was delivered successfully to the target field in the business app, and switches the focus back to the scanner overlay. The remaining undelivered data is then sent to the scanner overlay instead of the business app. Resolution In the Knox Capture profile settings, navigate to Keystroke output > Set key event delay and extend the length of time before the foreground focus switches back to the scanner overlay. By default, the key event delay is set to 0 ms. The delay you set occurs between individual key events sent to the business app. For example, when sending scan data that's 10 characters long with a 50 ms key event delay, a 500 ms total delay can be observed.

.3.00.7: Samsung Galaxy S21, Samsung Galaxy XCover Pro, Galaxy Tab Active3 You can resolve this issue by sending a Pause command before you send the barcode data. To do this: 1.

Tap Add Actions again, then select Send remaining characters and tap Add. 4. Verify that the two actions, Send Pause and Send remaining characters, are on the rule screen. 5. Close the Knox Capture app and perform a test scan in Chrome or Samsung Internet. #Enable the Floating Action Button (FAB) You can also resolve this issue by using a Floating Action Button (FAB) instead of the hardware key to perform a scan. To enable the FAB in Knox Capture, refer to step 6 in Set camera scan trigger. #Workaround using another web browser To avoid this issue altogether, you can output your scanned data to a web browser built with a different browser engine, such as Mozilla Firefox.

. Previously, if a Bluetooth device was paired and the slider was in the OFF position, the Paired devices list would still show a list of disconnected devices. Now, the list only displays paired devices (connected or disconnected) if the slider is in the ON position. Known issues #Possible low barcode detection rate in certain glare or tiny conditions Testers have reported that Knox Capture can have difficulties detecting all barcodes under extreme glare conditions. It is recommended that users attempt to block or cover any glare on the barcodes before scanning. For customers who use Code 93 and Code 128 barcodes specifically, Knox Capture may have difficulties scanning barcodes that are too small. It is recommended that customers avoid using tiny barcodes whenver possible to increase the success rate of scans

Scanning profiles. Knox Capture acts as a wedge by translating barcode data into keystrokes that can be sent to a business application. But how does Knox Capture know what barcode types to scan, how to interpret scanned data, and which business applications to pass the data to? For Knox Capture, the *Scanning profile* defines the app's core behavior. A Scanning Profile is a configuration file that gets created or modified by an IT admin using the Knox Capture application. The profile defines how Knox Capture performs a barcode scan, and primarily consists of the following parameters: 1. Apps and activities - define which applications that can launch the Knox Capture scanner. 2. Scanner engine settings - specifying the barcode technologies (QR, Code 128, UPCA, etc.), scanning methods (single barcode, multi barcode), and camera behavior (enable flash, allow camera zoom). 3. Keystroke output rules - specifying how barcode data gets converted into keystrokes (append Tab or Enter character to each barcode, add prefix or suffix characters, convert output to hex characters, etc.) Default scanning profile Out-of-the-box, Knox Capture includes a default scanning profile that gets automatically associated with all apps on the device. In other words, when Knox Capture is launched, *any* app can trigger the camera scanner and receive barcode data in the form of keystrokes. This makes it easy to use Knox Capture for basic scanning purposes without any additional setup. When using the default scanning profile, IT admins can change the profile's scan engine settings and data processing rules, however they cannot change the default profile's apps and activities behavior. For example, an IT admin can modify the default profile to append a Tab key at the end of each barcode, but they cannot change which apps can trigger the scanner. Custom scanning profiles While the default scanning profile allows Knox Capture to be used right away without any configuration, IT admins may want to use a custom profile to better suit their needs. With a custom profile, IT admins control which apps and activities can trigger a barcode scan. Any apps that you don't select in the custom profile will follow the default behavior in that the barcode scanner is active for all apps not specified in the custom profile. Creating custom scanning profiles Custom profiles can be created by modifying the default profile settings, or by creating entirely new profiles altogether. 1. Tap the + button near the top of the app UI to open the profile creation options. 2. Select Create profile to start a profile from scratch, or select Duplicate existing profile to copy the settings from an existing (custom or default) profile. Alternatively, you can create a custom profile by clicking Create profile without clicking the + button. 3. Provide a profile name, then tap Done. The new profile appears in the profiles area below Defult scanning profile.",759

Export and deploy configuration. Knox Capture uses a simple EMM-based deployment model. You first need to export a scanning configuration as a .txt file, then use an EMM add the file to your app configuration to deploy Knox Capture as a managed-app to your end-users. Exporting a configuration Exporting and sharing a scan configuration enables other devices apply the configuration to their installation. #Export options An IT admin can use several methods to export the configuration: Save it as a file on the device. Email it as a file attachment. Use Nearby share to send to another IT admin's device, Generate a QR code that can be scanned by other IT admins. To share a configuration on a per-device basis, transfer the configuration using near-field communication (NFC) or with a QR code. #Launch the export menu Regardless of the export method selected, begin by tapping the Share button in the lower-right of the home page to launch the Share configuration menu. #Save as file To save the file: 1. Tap the Save icon in the Share configuration menu. 2. Enter a name and tap Done. Knox Capture saves the configuration within My Files > Downloads, and displays a success message. #Email file To email the configuration as a text file attachment with the default email program: 1. Tap the email icon within the Share configuration menu. 2. Knox Capture launches the email application and starts a new message with the configuration file attached. #Nearby share To share a configuration with another device using Nearby share: 1. Tap the Nearby icon within the Share configuration menu. 2. Ensure Nearby Share is turned on for both the transmitting and receiving devices. 3. On the receiving device, tap the Device nearby is sharing popup that appears. #QR code To generate a QR code that can be scanned by other devices to import the configuration, tap the QR code option in the Share configuration menu. Knox Capture generates and displays a QR code. Optionally save or email the QR code by tapping either the Save or Email button. Tap Save to save the QR code as an image within the device My Files > Downloads folder. Tap Email to launch the default email app. The resulting email message includes instructions for importing the configuration using the QR code. If the configuration is too large for one QR code, Knox Capture generates multiple QR codes in a PDF file. The end user must scan them all to complete the import process. Deploying through an EMM To deploy Knox Capture with a custom scanning configuration across a fleet of devices, set the scan configuration and use the EMM console to add it to Knox Capture's App Config in Managed Google Play. Doing so ensures devices that the app runs for end-users in Managed mode. Deployment varies depending on the EMM provider, but should resemble the following flow: 1. Install Knox Capture on an admin device, configure the app, and export the configuration as a text file. 2. Add the Knox Capture app to your Managed Google Play Store. 3. Assign the app to a group or organization and launch the app configuration dialog. In most consoles, the app configuration (or App Config) dialog opens as a pop-up window or modal. 4. Activate your license in the EMM. 5. Copy and paste the text of the exported Knox Capture configuration into the provided configuration field. 6. Save the updated settings and deploy. If you do not add a configuration for Knox Capture in Managed Google Play when updating a license key, the app operates according to its _previous_ configuration. For example, a device with an existing scan configuration will continue to operate in Managed mode after updating the license key. However, a new device without an existing configuration will operate in Admin mode. To ensure _all_ devices operate in Managed mode, prepare and include the configuration each time you add or modify the app within the EMM console. Sharing and importing configurations Once a configuration has been exported, it can be shared with other devices running the app in Admin mode",190

Barcode 1 
Barcode 2
Barcode 3  
Barcode 4
Barcode 5
Barcode 6

These barcodes are provided in the context for testing the Knox Capture AR features. The context says ""Use the following barcodes to test the Knox Capture AR features.""",1,1,6,1.0,0.9995133876800537,1.0,0,22.94699740409851,"AR demo barcodes.

. This could lead to re-scans and additional worker overhead in order to capture the proper data. When a user triggers a barcode scan using Knox Capture AR, the camera preview window gets augmented with a customizable overlay that allows the user to view, analyze, and interact with the barcode data in real-time. For example, a retail worker using AR to scan an item could view information like the product's model number, sale price, or remaining inventory count, all from within the camera preview window, without ever having to open their business app to review the data. About AR templates Just like how scanning profiles define core Knox Capture behavior like which apps can trigger a scan, which barcodes are accepted, and what happens to data after it gets captured, AR templates also define the characteristics and behaviors of the Knox Capture AR feature

AR overview. The Knox Capture AR (Augmented Reality) is a feature that allows users to view important, business-critical information on the device screen when peforming a barcode scan. Normally, whenever a user launches the scanner, aims their camera at one or more barcodes, and captures the barcode data, Knox Capture simply passes the barcode information back to the business-app for review for the user to review. There is no way for the user to interact with any of the information until it reaches the business-app. To some organizations, scanning several barcodes and reviewing the data only _after_ it reaches the business-app can be inefficient, especially if the information isn't what they were looking for in the first place. This could lead to re-scans and additional worker overhead in order to capture the proper data

Demo AR. As an IT admin, you can demo the Knox Capture AR features without having to set up a real server or go through any profile configuration or setup process. AR demo mode only supports the View-and-update template. To learn more about templates, see AR overview. Before you begin Before you can demo the AR features, you'll first need to display the Knox Capture demo AR barcodes on a screen. To do this, simply open the demo AR barcodes page on a computer or separate mobile device, then scan these barcodes to test the AR features. View demo AR barcodes. Try AR demo mode Once you have the sample barcodes available, you can demo the AR features. To do this: 1. Go to the Knox Capture app's home screen, then tap the options menu button and select Knox Capture AR. 2. On the Knox Capture Augmented Reality screen, tap Demo AR, then tap Start. 3.

Normally, whenever a user launches the scanner, aims their camera at one or more barcodes, and captures the barcode data, Knox Capture simply passes the barcode information back to the business-app for review for the user to review. There is no way for the user to interact with any of the information until it reaches the business-app. To some organizations, scanning several barcodes and reviewing the data only _after_ it reaches the business-app can be inefficient, especially if the information isn't what they were looking for in the first place. This could lead to re-scans and additional worker overhead in order to capture the proper data. When a user triggers a barcode scan using Knox Capture AR, the camera preview window gets augmented with a customizable overlay that allows the user to view, analyze, and interact with the barcode data in real-time. For example, a retail worker using AR to scan an item could view information like the product's model number, sale price, or remaining inventory count, all from within the camera preview window, without ever having to open their business app to review the data. About AR templates Just like how scanning profiles define core Knox Capture behavior like which apps can trigger a scan, which barcodes are accepted, and what happens to data after it gets captured, AR templates also define the characteristics and behaviors of the Knox Capture AR feature. #Search-and-find templates This AR template provides an overlay to help users locate and isolate a single barcode when several similar barcodes are in the camera preview window. For example, a retail worker may be asked to locate a single box from a large wall of boxes in a warehouse. Using Knox Capture AR, the worker can start by scanning a reference barcode of the item they're searching for. After the reference barcode is scanned, the worker simply needs to point their camera at the wall of boxes in the warehouse. Knox Capture AR then analyzes each barcode in view, looking for a match. When a match is found, the AR overlay highlights the barcode, and additional product information is provided to the worker for review. #View-and-update templates This AR template provides an overlay to allow users to view product information and make real-time updates to a product database whenever a barcode is scanned. For example, a retail worker may want to know if there is enough inventory of a certain item before making a large-quantity transaction. Using Knox Capture AR, the worker can scan one of the items to bring up additional product information in the AR overlay. The worker can then see how many items are available in stock, and (after making the sale) immediately update their product database with a new stock count in real-time. See also , Refer to the Configure Knox Capture AR guide for instructions on creating Search-and-find and View-and-update AR templates as an IT admin. Refer to the Use Knox Capture AR guide for instructions on how to use AR templates to scan barcodes as an IT admin or end-user.

Knox Capture v1.2 release notes. This Knox Capture v1.2 release, scheduled to go live on July 30, 2021, includes several new features and improvements to existing functionality. Starting with Knox Capture v1.2, devices running an Android version lower than 11 (R) are not supported. On these devices, downloading Knox Capture from the Google Play store installs v1.1 instead. All customers should upgrade devices to Android 11 (R) OS binary before v1.2 can be downloaded. Expanded device support In Knox Capture v1.2, support is added for the following devices: Galaxy XCover 4S, Galaxy Tab Active Pro, Galaxy S20, Galaxy S21 Only the keyboard scan icon and floating scan button are supported on non-rugged devices (S20 and S21). For a full list of supported devices, see Supported devices. Keystroke output support in WP-C deployments In previous Knox Capture versions, if an IT admin activated a KPE Premium license with a WP-C deployment, remote injection was blocked in WP-C mode. As a workaround, `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` must be set to True to support keystroke output. With this release, keystroke output in WP-C deployments is supported regardless of whether `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` is set to True. Keystroke output support is not yet available for Galaxy S20 devices. You must use the aforementioned workaround to use keystroke output on Galaxy S20 devices. Option to disable default profile IT admins can now enable or disable the default profile. If you create profiles for several applications and don't want the default profile's behavior to override any configurations, set the default profile to Off. The default profile setting is available on the Knox Capture main page. You can change the configuration at any time, export and deploy it to end users in Managed mode. If a profile is not active for an app or foreground activity and the end user attempts to scan a barcode, an error message is shown stating that the application does not support Knox Capture scanning. This setting cannot be changed in Managed mode. New floating button scan trigger !Hardware scan trigger setting !Hardware scan trigger setting A floating scan button is now available that launches the Knox Capture camera for scanning. By default, the scan button appears in the bottom right corner of the device's screen. Users can move it around the screen, and it remains in the last known position until it's toggled off. The scan button can be used in both Admin and Managed modes. See Set camera trigger for more information on the various available triggers. License activation menu for unmanaged devices Previously, Knox Capture licenses could only be used by organizations pushing them through an MDM. Starting from Knox Capture v1.2, IT admins can now activate Knox Capture licenses in-app using the new license activation menu. To deactivate an entered license key, uninstall the Knox Capture app from your device. The license activation menu is only available in Admin mode. For more information, see Activate your license. Support for exporting large configurations through QR code !Multiple QR code export This Knox Capture version extends the QR code export functionality to support larger configurations. Prior to v1.2, IT admins couldn't select QR code as the export method if the configuration size was too large. Now, multiple QR codes are generated in a PDF file for the end user to scan. The device prompts the user to scan them all before the configuration can be successfully imported to Knox Capture. To learn more, see Export a scanning configuration and Import a scanning configuration. Persistent scan sessions IT admins and end users can now pick up calls, switch apps, and clear tasks during scan sessions without losing scanned data. Rebooting the device has no impact on saved scan data. In multi-scan sessions where the user leaves the business app and returns, they are prompted to either continue the original scan session or begin a new one

Scanning profiles. Knox Capture acts as a wedge by translating barcode data into keystrokes that can be sent to a business application. But how does Knox Capture know what barcode types to scan, how to interpret scanned data, and which business applications to pass the data to? For Knox Capture, the *Scanning profile* defines the app's core behavior. A Scanning Profile is a configuration file that gets created or modified by an IT admin using the Knox Capture application. The profile defines how Knox Capture performs a barcode scan, and primarily consists of the following parameters: 1. Apps and activities - define which applications that can launch the Knox Capture scanner. 2. Scanner engine settings - specifying the barcode technologies (QR, Code 128, UPCA, etc.), scanning methods (single barcode, multi barcode), and camera behavior (enable flash, allow camera zoom). 3

. This could lead to re-scans and additional worker overhead in order to capture the proper data. When a user triggers a barcode scan using Knox Capture AR, the camera preview window gets augmented with a customizable overlay that allows the user to view, analyze, and interact with the barcode data in real-time. For example, a retail worker using AR to scan an item could view information like the product's model number, sale price, or remaining inventory count, all from within the camera preview window, without ever having to open their business app to review the data. About AR templates Just like how scanning profiles define core Knox Capture behavior like which apps can trigger a scan, which barcodes are accepted, and what happens to data after it gets captured, AR templates also define the characteristics and behaviors of the Knox Capture AR feature

Keystroke output rules - specifying how barcode data gets converted into keystrokes (append Tab or Enter character to each barcode, add prefix or suffix characters, convert output to hex characters, etc.) Default scanning profile Out-of-the-box, Knox Capture includes a default scanning profile that gets automatically associated with all apps on the device. In other words, when Knox Capture is launched, *any* app can trigger the camera scanner and receive barcode data in the form of keystrokes. This makes it easy to use Knox Capture for basic scanning purposes without any additional setup. When using the default scanning profile, IT admins can change the profile's scan engine settings and data processing rules, however they cannot change the default profile's apps and activities behavior. For example, an IT admin can modify the default profile to append a Tab key at the end of each barcode, but they cannot change which apps can trigger the scanner. Custom scanning profiles While the default scanning profile allows Knox Capture to be used right away without any configuration, IT admins may want to use a custom profile to better suit their needs. With a custom profile, IT admins control which apps and activities can trigger a barcode scan. Any apps that you don't select in the custom profile will follow the default behavior in that the barcode scanner is active for all apps not specified in the custom profile. Creating custom scanning profiles Custom profiles can be created by modifying the default profile settings, or by creating entirely new profiles altogether. 1. Tap the + button near the top of the app UI to open the profile creation options. 2. Select Create profile to start a profile from scratch, or select Duplicate existing profile to copy the settings from an existing (custom or default) profile. Alternatively, you can create a custom profile by clicking Create profile without clicking the + button. 3. Provide a profile name, then tap Done. The new profile appears in the profiles area below Defult scanning profile.

Keystroke output data sent to browser or web app instead of business app. Overview Certain company-owned devices with a work profile might encounter an issue where barcode data sent through keystroke output is delivered to a browser or web app instead of the business app. Cause With recent improvements to company-owned devices with a work profile, a change was made to the way web apps - apps delivered through the browser instead of natively on Android - handle text view focus after scanning. On devices running Android 10 and lower, the text view is already in focus when scanned data returns to the business app. This focus behavior is no longer required with company-owned devices with a work profile running Android 11 and higher. Resolution To handle this change, you must enable the Allow remote control policy in your EMM to allow Knox Capture to restore focus to the text view. You only need to enable this policy if you've activated a Knox Platform for Enterprise Premium license.

Knox Capture v1.2 release notes. This Knox Capture v1.2 release, scheduled to go live on July 30, 2021, includes several new features and improvements to existing functionality. Starting with Knox Capture v1.2, devices running an Android version lower than 11 (R) are not supported. On these devices, downloading Knox Capture from the Google Play store installs v1.1 instead. All customers should upgrade devices to Android 11 (R) OS binary before v1.2 can be downloaded. Expanded device support In Knox Capture v1.2, support is added for the following devices: Galaxy XCover 4S, Galaxy Tab Active Pro, Galaxy S20, Galaxy S21 Only the keyboard scan icon and floating scan button are supported on non-rugged devices (S20 and S21).

Knox Capture v1.2 release notes. This Knox Capture v1.2 release, scheduled to go live on July 30, 2021, includes several new features and improvements to existing functionality. Starting with Knox Capture v1.2, devices running an Android version lower than 11 (R) are not supported. On these devices, downloading Knox Capture from the Google Play store installs v1.1 instead. All customers should upgrade devices to Android 11 (R) OS binary before v1.2 can be downloaded. Expanded device support In Knox Capture v1.2, support is added for the following devices: Galaxy XCover 4S, Galaxy Tab Active Pro, Galaxy S20, Galaxy S21 Only the keyboard scan icon and floating scan button are supported on non-rugged devices (S20 and S21). For a full list of supported devices, see Supported devices. Keystroke output support in WP-C deployments In previous Knox Capture versions, if an IT admin activated a KPE Premium license with a WP-C deployment, remote injection was blocked in WP-C mode. As a workaround, `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` must be set to True to support keystroke output. With this release, keystroke output in WP-C deployments is supported regardless of whether `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` is set to True. Keystroke output support is not yet available for Galaxy S20 devices. You must use the aforementioned workaround to use keystroke output on Galaxy S20 devices. Option to disable default profile IT admins can now enable or disable the default profile. If you create profiles for several applications and don't want the default profile's behavior to override any configurations, set the default profile to Off. The default profile setting is available on the Knox Capture main page. You can change the configuration at any time, export and deploy it to end users in Managed mode. If a profile is not active for an app or foreground activity and the end user attempts to scan a barcode, an error message is shown stating that the application does not support Knox Capture scanning. This setting cannot be changed in Managed mode. New floating button scan trigger !Hardware scan trigger setting !Hardware scan trigger setting A floating scan button is now available that launches the Knox Capture camera for scanning. By default, the scan button appears in the bottom right corner of the device's screen. Users can move it around the screen, and it remains in the last known position until it's toggled off. The scan button can be used in both Admin and Managed modes. See Set camera trigger for more information on the various available triggers. License activation menu for unmanaged devices Previously, Knox Capture licenses could only be used by organizations pushing them through an MDM. Starting from Knox Capture v1.2, IT admins can now activate Knox Capture licenses in-app using the new license activation menu. To deactivate an entered license key, uninstall the Knox Capture app from your device. The license activation menu is only available in Admin mode. For more information, see Activate your license. Support for exporting large configurations through QR code !Multiple QR code export This Knox Capture version extends the QR code export functionality to support larger configurations. Prior to v1.2, IT admins couldn't select QR code as the export method if the configuration size was too large. Now, multiple QR codes are generated in a PDF file for the end user to scan. The device prompts the user to scan them all before the configuration can be successfully imported to Knox Capture. To learn more, see Export a scanning configuration and Import a scanning configuration. Persistent scan sessions IT admins and end users can now pick up calls, switch apps, and clear tasks during scan sessions without losing scanned data. Rebooting the device has no impact on saved scan data. In multi-scan sessions where the user leaves the business app and returns, they are prompted to either continue the original scan session or begin a new one",503

Configure keystroke output and data formatting. Knox Capture sends scanned data to business apps as keystrokes, imitating the way a user manually enters data using a keyboard. If you activate a KPE (Knox Platform for Enterprise) Premium license with a Galaxy S20 device in WP-C mode, you must set `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` to True in your EMM. Enabling this policy allows keystroke output to function as expected. Keystroke output Refer to the following settings to modify scanned data and format its output: Setting Description Options Default Send Enter character as Sets the output format for all existing and appended Enters Key event &mdash; Sends Enter as a key event.

Multi scan , Detects multiple barcodes in the scan area at the same time. #Single scan preferences Sets the way a user selects barcodes when interacting with the camera scanning UI in Single scan mode. Available options: Setting Options Barcode selection Automatic (default) &mdash; Captures the first-detected barcode without additional user input. Aim and scan &mdash; Requires the user to aim the camera at a barcode and tap the Scan button to capture barcode data. Continuous scanning Off (default) On &mdash; Allow device users to scan several barcodes in sequence (and have each scan be registered as a single event) without having to press the camera trigger button between each scan.1 1 Device users will see a Scan button in the camera preview window when they trigger a barcode scan. Device users can simply tap Scan each time they want to capture a new barcode. As each barcode is scanned, a counter in the top-left corner of the preview window gets updated. Once the user is finished scanning, they can click Done to close the camera preview window and return to the business app. #Multi scan preferences Sets the way a user selects barcodes when interacting with the camera scanning UI in Multi scan mode. Available options: Setting Options Barcode selection Automatic (default) &mdash; Allows the user to scan multiple barcodes without having to press a scan button. Batch &mdash; Lets the user scan multiple barcodes in a single camera frame using the scan button. Aim and scan &mdash; Requires the user to aim the camera at a set of barcodes and tap the Scan button to capture the barcodes, one at a time. Tap to select &mdash; Lets a user aim the camera at multiple barcodes, freeze the scanning overlay, tap to select barcodes, and tap the Scan button to capture data from the selected barcodes. Scan session limit This defines the number of barcodes a user must scan before the camera preview window closes. A counter in the top-left corner of the preview window gets updated after each scan. Once the user has scanned the set number of barcodes, the camera preview window closes and the user returns to the business app. Users can exit the camera preview window at any time by tapping Done, regardless of the number of barcodes captured. You can set any integer value. By default, this value is set to 0 to indicate infinite scans. #Beep after scan Emits a beep sound after each barcode scan. This is toggled On by default. #Vibrate after scan Vibrates the device after each barcode scan. This is toggled On by default. Camera settings Customize camera hardware and scanning UI options using the following settings: Setting Options Default Camera Back (default) Front Flashlight Off (default) &mdash; When a scan is triggered, the flashlight is turned off. A flashlight button is provided in the preview, and the button is off. On &mdash; When a scan is triggered, the flashlight is automatically turned on.

What manifest file needs to be edited to allow a business app to parse scanned data from Knox Capture?,AndroidManifest.xml,"

The AndroidManifest.xml file needs to be edited to allow a business app to parse scanned data from Knox Capture. The manifest file should be edited to define the package name, intent action and category in order for Knox Capture to send the correct intent output to the business app.",1,1,6,1.0,0.9969815611839294,1.0,0,15.625847101211548,". For business app developers #Edit the AndroidManifest.xml file For your business app to parse the scanned data, you need to set up Knox Capture to send it the correct intent output. To do so, edit AndroidManifest.xml to define the package name, intent action and category. Knox Capture offers three different methods for your app to receive an Android intent. Refer to Intent output settings for more details. The following is a snippet demonstrating the manifest information to edit. Ensure you replace any dummy strings with ones relevant to your app. ``` PackageName = applicationId ""com.test.smartscan"" AndroidManifest.xml ``` If you're using an activity to receive the intent: ``` ``` If you're using the foreground service to receive the intent: ``` ``` If you're using the broadcast receiver to receive the intent: ``` ``` Properly defining the intent filter information ensures that after each successful scan, Knox Capture delivers the intent to your business app through the chosen method

Use intent output. If your business app needs to obtain scanned data programmatically (for example, to process it further in-app), Knox Capture can pass the data within an Android intent object instead of through keystroke output. You can also enable intent output to work with keystroke output. For example, if you select Send via startActivity as your intent delivery method, Knox Capture first sends keystrokes to the foreground activity, then sends the intent to the new activity instance. To use Knox Capture's intent output feature: Business app developers must ensure the business app receives the intent, and, IT admins must configure Knox Capture's Intent output feature accordingly. The information in this section is divided into instructions for business app developers and instructions for Knox Capture admins. For business app developers #Edit the AndroidManifest.xml file For your business app to parse the scanned data, you need to set up Knox Capture to send it the correct intent output

Scanning profiles. Knox Capture acts as a wedge by translating barcode data into keystrokes that can be sent to a business application. But how does Knox Capture know what barcode types to scan, how to interpret scanned data, and which business applications to pass the data to? For Knox Capture, the *Scanning profile* defines the app's core behavior. A Scanning Profile is a configuration file that gets created or modified by an IT admin using the Knox Capture application. The profile defines how Knox Capture performs a barcode scan, and primarily consists of the following parameters: 1. Apps and activities - define which applications that can launch the Knox Capture scanner. 2. Scanner engine settings - specifying the barcode technologies (QR, Code 128, UPCA, etc.), scanning methods (single barcode, multi barcode), and camera behavior (enable flash, allow camera zoom). 3

If test mode is active, the intent is not sent and the business app is not launched. Instead, the following error message appears, notifying you that test mode is active: `Not Start Activity in TestMode!` The key/value pair that signifies test mode status is as follows: ``` Key:= ProfileConstants.KEY_INTENT_TEST_MODE=""intent_in_testmode"" Value:= true/false : whether Knox Capture test mode is on. ``` ##The list of scanned bundles The key/value pair that contains the scanned barcode data is as follows: ``` Key:= ProfileConstants.INTENT_OUTPUT_SCANNED_BUNDLE_LIST= ""com.samsung.smartscan.scanned_bundle_list"" Value:= bundle list : the scanned barcode data const val INTENT_OUTPUT_UNPROCESSED_RAW_DATA = ""com.samsung.smartscan.unprocessed_raw_data"" const val INTENT_OUTPUT_UNPROCESSED_STRING_DATA = ""com.samsung.smartscan.unprocessed_string_data"" const val INTENT_OUTPUT_SYMBLOGY_TYPE = ""com.samsung.smartscan.symblogy_type"" const val INTENT_OUTPUT_SCAN_SOURCE = ""com.samsung.smartscan.scan_source"" const val INTENT_OUTPUT_SCANNER_TYPE = ""com.samsung.smartscan.scanner_type"" ``` ##The bundle structure ``` const val KEY_SCANNER_TYPE_CAMERA = ""camera"" ``` #Reading the intent output information The following code snippet, written in Kotlin, demonstrates how to get and read the data sent from Knox Capture. ``` fun getAllExtraInfo(intent: Intent):String bundleItem.getString(INTENT_OUTPUT_SCAN_SOURCE)?.let bundleItem.getString(INTENT_OUTPUT_SYMBLOGY_TYPE)?.let bundleItem.getStringArrayList(INTENT_OUTPUT_UNPROCESSED_STRING_DATA)?.let }, \n"") } bundleItem.getByteArray(INTENT_OUTPUT_UNPROCESSED_RAW_DATA)?.let "") } sb.append(""]"") } sb.append(""}"") } return sb.toString() } ``` #Knox Capture configuration You must instruct the IT admin to configure the same package and intent delivery method as specified in the AndroidManifest.xml file.

Keystroke output rules - specifying how barcode data gets converted into keystrokes (append Tab or Enter character to each barcode, add prefix or suffix characters, convert output to hex characters, etc.) Default scanning profile Out-of-the-box, Knox Capture includes a default scanning profile that gets automatically associated with all apps on the device. In other words, when Knox Capture is launched, *any* app can trigger the camera scanner and receive barcode data in the form of keystrokes. This makes it easy to use Knox Capture for basic scanning purposes without any additional setup. When using the default scanning profile, IT admins can change the profile's scan engine settings and data processing rules, however they cannot change the default profile's apps and activities behavior. For example, an IT admin can modify the default profile to append a Tab key at the end of each barcode, but they cannot change which apps can trigger the scanner. Custom scanning profiles While the default scanning profile allows Knox Capture to be used right away without any configuration, IT admins may want to use a custom profile to better suit their needs. With a custom profile, IT admins control which apps and activities can trigger a barcode scan. Any apps that you don't select in the custom profile will follow the default behavior in that the barcode scanner is active for all apps not specified in the custom profile. Creating custom scanning profiles Custom profiles can be created by modifying the default profile settings, or by creating entirely new profiles altogether. 1. Tap the + button near the top of the app UI to open the profile creation options. 2. Select Create profile to start a profile from scratch, or select Duplicate existing profile to copy the settings from an existing (custom or default) profile. Alternatively, you can create a custom profile by clicking Create profile without clicking the + button. 3. Provide a profile name, then tap Done. The new profile appears in the profiles area below Defult scanning profile.",285

Use intent output. If your business app needs to obtain scanned data programmatically (for example, to process it further in-app), Knox Capture can pass the data within an Android intent object instead of through keystroke output. You can also enable intent output to work with keystroke output. For example, if you select Send via startActivity as your intent delivery method, Knox Capture first sends keystrokes to the foreground activity, then sends the intent to the new activity instance. To use Knox Capture's intent output feature: Business app developers must ensure the business app receives the intent, and, IT admins must configure Knox Capture's Intent output feature accordingly.

How could allowing users to view important information directly in the AR interface when scanning barcodes improve efficiency for some organizations?,"By allowing users to view important information directly in the AR interface when scanning barcodes, organizations could increase efficiency by reducing the need for additional scans and allowing for quicker data verification, reducing worker overhead and potentially reducing instances of incorrectly scanned data that needs to be re-scanned.","

Allowing users to view important information directly in the AR interface when scanning barcodes could improve efficiency for some organizations in a few ways:

1) It allows workers to interact with and analyze barcode data in real-time without having to open the business app to review it after capture. This saves time compared to scanning multiple barcodes and only seeing the data after reaching the app.

2) Workers can see if scanned information is what they need right away rather than potentially having to rescan items. This avoids inefficiency from rescanning barcodes unnecessarily.  

3) Specific product details like inventory counts can be immediately viewed and updated through the AR interface. This allows workers to get the info they need and make database changes on the spot.",1,1,6,1.0,0.9999210834503174,0.0,0,23.84490656852722,"AR overview.

<question>Can you explain the purpose of a view-and-update AR template in Knox Capture? What actions can a user take with this type of template?</question>

The purpose of a view-and-update AR template in Knox Capture is to allow users to view product information and make real-time updates to a product database whenever a barcode is scanned. 

With a view-and-update template, when a user scans a barcode, additional product information pops up in an AR overlay above the barcode. The user can see details like the product name, image, inventory count, etc. without having to open another app. 

The user can also update the product database in real-time through the AR overlay after making a transaction. For example, a retail worker could update the inventory count or other fields that were given database WRITE permissions after making a sale.

So in summary, the key actions a user can take with a view-and-update template are:
- View product details overlaid above a scanned barcode
- Update permitted fields in a connected database in real-time through the AR overlay",1,1,6,1.0,0.9998084902763367,1.0,0,9.679695129394531,". #View-and-update templates This AR template provides an overlay to allow users to view product information and make real-time updates to a product database whenever a barcode is scanned.

AR overview. The Knox Capture AR (Augmented Reality) is a feature that allows users to view important, business-critical information on the device screen when peforming a barcode scan. Normally, whenever a user launches the scanner, aims their camera at one or more barcodes, and captures the barcode data, Knox Capture simply passes the barcode information back to the business-app for review for the user to review. There is no way for the user to interact with any of the information until it reaches the business-app. To some organizations, scanning several barcodes and reviewing the data only _after_ it reaches the business-app can be inefficient, especially if the information isn't what they were looking for in the first place. This could lead to re-scans and additional worker overhead in order to capture the proper data. When a user triggers a barcode scan using Knox Capture AR, the camera preview window gets augmented with a customizable overlay that allows the user to view, analyze, and interact with the barcode data in real-time. For example, a retail worker using AR to scan an item could view information like the product's model number, sale price, or remaining inventory count, all from within the camera preview window, without ever having to open their business app to review the data.

Change this property to include lengths not enabled by default, or to optimize decoding performance for a certain number of symbols. Character-to-symbol mapping depends on barcode type. For example, some barcodes include additional checksum characters in their symbol counts. For more information on active symbol count, refer to Configure the Active Symbol Count. Depends on barcode type. Max. length Determines the maximum supported barcode length (active symbol count) to decode. Depends on barcode type. Inverted color recognition Enables recognition of inverted barcodes that have been printed using bright ink on a dark background. ON/OFF OFF Reduced quiet zone-size Enables scanning codes with smaller than normal quiet zones (white space before and after the code) than allowed by the barcode type specification. Use this if you experience issues when scanning codes that violate quiet zone specifications. Please note that turning on this feature may lead to false positive scans in some cases. ON/OFF OFF Strip leading FNC1 Removes the leading FNC1 character that indicates a GS1 code. ON/OFF OFF Direct part marking mode Improves scan performance when reading direct part marked (DPM) Data Matrix codes. Please note that this setting increases frame processing times. Samsung recommends restricting the scanning area to a smaller portion of the screen for better performance when using direct part marking mode. ON/OFF OFF Checksum mod n Barcode checksums use a piece of barcode data and a checksum algorithm to ensure data transmission integrity. Some barcode types include a mandatory checksum, while others only have optional checksums. Enforcing an optional checksum helps reduce false positives and provides an extra layer of error prevention. When enabling a checksum, ensure your barcode data includes the calculated checksum, otherwise the checksum will not match and the barcode data is discarded. Uses and enforces a modulo n checksum algorithm. ON/OFF OFF Full ASCII support Interprets Code39 data using two symbols per output character to encode all ASCII characters. ON/OFF OFF Double checksum mod n Uses and enforces a double checksum modulo n. ON/OFF OFF Remove leading zero Removes the leading zero digit from EAN13/UCPA scanned barcode data. ON/OFF ON Return as UPCA Transforms UPCE scanned barcode data into its UPCA representation

Out-of-range barcode still scanned successfully by Knox Capture. Overview For example, assuming you've set a symbol count range of 7 - 20 for Code 128 barcodes, the following situations may occur: Code ""1234567"" (length 7) can be successfully scanned. Code ""12345678"" (length 8) can be successfully scanned. Code ""123456"" (length 6) can't be successfully scanned. Code ""12345"" (length 5) can be successfully scanned. This is unexpected behavior. Code ""1234"" (length 4) can't be successfully scanned. Cause When setting the scan length, there's a difference between the number of digits or characters and the active symbol count. The correlation between characters and symbol counts depends on the encoding standard. For instance, Code 128 differs from Code 39. For Code 128, there are three different encoding schemes that can be mixed within a single Code 128 barcode to achieve the shortest possible code. Resolution Check which encoding standards your barcode data follows.",460

For example, you can create a rule to send only the last 4 digits of a barcode to a business app. For more information, refer to Advanced data formatting. Keyboard scan button input method A scan button has been added to the device keyboard that launches the Knox Capture camera for scanning. On devices running OneUI 2.1, the scan button is added to the last position on the keyboard toolbar. On devices with OneUI 2.5 and above, installing Knox Capture adds the scan button to the first position on the keyboard toolbar by default. In both cases, you can drag and drop the button to change its position. If a device was upgraded to OneUI 2.5 or above after installing Knox Capture, the scan button remains in the same position on the keyboard as it was before the upgrade. Pinch-to-zoom gestures for scanning When scanning barcodes using Knox Capture, users can now use pinch gestures to increase or decrease the scan range up to a maximum of 4x resolution. In single-scan mode, the capture screen resets to the original zoom factor after each scan. In multi-scan mode, the screen remains zoomed in or out for the remainder of the scan session. Intent output Knox Capture v1.1 adds support for intent output. As an IT admin, you can configure scan data to be sent programmatically to a business app when triggered by an Android intent. Upon scanning, the app acquires the data and can either consume or process it further. Refer to Intent output for more details. WP-C mode support Knox Capture is now compatible with work profile on company owned devices (WP-C), which is replacing fully managed devices with a work profile in Android 11. In WP-C mode, Knox Capture supports business apps installed in the same device area - for example, if both Knox Capture and the business app are inside the work profile. Nearby Share support Starting from Android 10, NFC is deprecated and replaced with Nearby Share to enhance user privacy. Knox Capture v1.1 supports importing and exporting profile configurations using Nearby Share, allowing you to quickly share configurations with devices in your proximity. Back to release notes",236

Scanning profiles. Knox Capture acts as a wedge by translating barcode data into keystrokes that can be sent to a business application. But how does Knox Capture know what barcode types to scan, how to interpret scanned data, and which business applications to pass the data to? For Knox Capture, the *Scanning profile* defines the app's core behavior. A Scanning Profile is a configuration file that gets created or modified by an IT admin using the Knox Capture application. The profile defines how Knox Capture performs a barcode scan, and primarily consists of the following parameters: 1. Apps and activities - define which applications that can launch the Knox Capture scanner. 2. Scanner engine settings - specifying the barcode technologies (QR, Code 128, UPCA, etc.), scanning methods (single barcode, multi barcode), and camera behavior (enable flash, allow camera zoom). 3. Keystroke output rules - specifying how barcode data gets converted into keystrokes (append Tab or Enter character to each barcode, add prefix or suffix characters, convert output to hex characters, etc.) Default scanning profile Out-of-the-box, Knox Capture includes a default scanning profile that gets automatically associated with all apps on the device. In other words, when Knox Capture is launched, *any* app can trigger the camera scanner and receive barcode data in the form of keystrokes. This makes it easy to use Knox Capture for basic scanning purposes without any additional setup. When using the default scanning profile, IT admins can change the profile's scan engine settings and data processing rules, however they cannot change the default profile's apps and activities behavior. For example, an IT admin can modify the default profile to append a Tab key at the end of each barcode, but they cannot change which apps can trigger the scanner. Custom scanning profiles While the default scanning profile allows Knox Capture to be used right away without any configuration, IT admins may want to use a custom profile to better suit their needs. With a custom profile, IT admins control which apps and activities can trigger a barcode scan. Any apps that you don't select in the custom profile will follow the default behavior in that the barcode scanner is active for all apps not specified in the custom profile. Creating custom scanning profiles Custom profiles can be created by modifying the default profile settings, or by creating entirely new profiles altogether. 1. Tap the + button near the top of the app UI to open the profile creation options. 2. Select Create profile to start a profile from scratch, or select Duplicate existing profile to copy the settings from an existing (custom or default) profile. Alternatively, you can create a custom profile by clicking Create profile without clicking the + button. 3. Provide a profile name, then tap Done. The new profile appears in the profiles area below Defult scanning profile.

This notification is enabled by default, but can be turned off by going to Knox Capture settings > Performance labs > Scanner toast notification. #Vibrate-notification after successful scan IT admins can now configure Knox Capture to vibrate the device after each successful barcode scan. This behavior is disabled by default, but can be enabled by going to a profile's Scan engine settings > Vibrate after scan. Enhancements #Output path accurately displays Paired devices list For customers who use their device as a Bluetooth wedge scanner to connect to a PC or host machine, Knox Capture now displays the Paired devices list only when the Use Bluetooth wedge slider is enabled

. If the user navigates to a different business app to initiate a scan instead, the original scan data is discarded. New indicators for tested app activities When testing configurations in Admin mode, IT admins can now view a list of created app activities under the profile. Any activity not visible in the list behaves under the default profile. After being tested, each activity displays a green checkmark to its right to indicate its tested status. Refer to Check a configuration in test mode to learn more. Hardware scanner support Knox Capture v1.2 adds support for USB and Bluetooth hardware scanners. After the scanner is paired or connected, IT admins and end users can switch between their device's camera and the scanner for seamless data capture and delivery to business apps. Currently, v1.2 supports all HW scanners with HID connection. Tests have been completed for the devices below: Koamtac KDC280 (Bluetooth), Koamtac KDC180 (Bluetooth), Koamtac SKXPro SmartSled (USB) - Only supported for Galaxy XCover Pro devices. For more information, see Connect a hardware scanner.

Knox Capture v1.8 release notes. New features Knox Capture v1.8 introduces the following new features: #Continuous single scan A new Continuous scanning option appears on the Scan engine settings > Single scan preferences screen. When this option is toggled On, device users can scan several barcodes in sequence - and have each scan be registered as a single event - without having to press the camera trigger button between each scan. To learn more about the Continuous scanning feature, see Single scan preferences. #Scanner overlay In this release, device users have the option to view the camera preview window as an overlay on top of their business app. When the Scanner overlay feature is enabled and a scan is triggered, users will see a mini camera preview window on top of their existing business app screen. To learn more about this new feature, see Scanner overlay. #Inverse color barcode support This release adds a new Performance lab feature that allows users to scan inverse colored barcodes. This feature only works with Data Matrix and QR type barcodes in this release. To enable this option, go to the Knox Capture main screen, then tap the Options button (three dots), tap Performance lab, then enable Inverted color recognition. Enhancements Knox Capture v1.8 includes the following enhancements to existing features: #More intuitive user prompts when connecting USB device Previously, users would get a prompt even if Knox Capture wasn't running in the foreground. For example, a user might want to connect a USB keyboard for use in their business. When connecting the keyboard, they would see a prompt asking if they wanted to use the USB keyboard for scanning purposes, even though they may not be using Knox Capture at the time. This release improves the prompt so that it only shows when Knox Capture is being used in the foreground. The device user must grant system permissions for connected devices in order for the prompt to display. If no permissions are granted, the prompt will not display on any screen. #Seamlessly switch between multiple paired devices in Output path If a user is paired with multiple devices in Knox Capture's Output path, they can now switch between each of their paired devices more easily. Previously, if a user had two paired devices in Output path, and Knox Capture was connected to _device A_, the user would first have to disconnect from _device A_ before connecting to _device B_. With this release, the user simply has to connect to _device B_. Knox Capture automatically disconnects from any previously paired devices. #Receive a notification when overlay is restricted by IT admin Some device users may experience an issue where they are unable to view the camera preview window after triggering a scan. This issue can be caused by a restriction set by the IT admin and the organization's UEM policy. Previously, if the restriction was set, the user would simply not be able to see the preview window. In this release, the user will now get a notification asking them to contact their IT admin for more information. To learn more about the restriction, see the Knox Capture Knowledge Base Article (KBA) related to this issue. Back to release notes",416

Knox Capture v1.8 release notes. New features Knox Capture v1.8 introduces the following new features: #Continuous single scan A new Continuous scanning option appears on the Scan engine settings > Single scan preferences screen. When this option is toggled On, device users can scan several barcodes in sequence - and have each scan be registered as a single event - without having to press the camera trigger button between each scan. To learn more about the Continuous scanning feature, see Single scan preferences. #Scanner overlay In this release, device users have the option to view the camera preview window as an overlay on top of their business app. When the Scanner overlay feature is enabled and a scan is triggered, users will see a mini camera preview window on top of their existing business app screen. To learn more about this new feature, see Scanner overlay. #Inverse color barcode support This release adds a new Performance lab feature that allows users to scan inverse colored barcodes. This feature only works with Data Matrix and QR type barcodes in this release. To enable this option, go to the Knox Capture main screen, then tap the Options button (three dots), tap Performance lab, then enable Inverted color recognition. Enhancements Knox Capture v1.8 includes the following enhancements to existing features: #More intuitive user prompts when connecting USB device Previously, users would get a prompt even if Knox Capture wasn't running in the foreground. For example, a user might want to connect a USB keyboard for use in their business. When connecting the keyboard, they would see a prompt asking if they wanted to use the USB keyboard for scanning purposes, even though they may not be using Knox Capture at the time. This release improves the prompt so that it only shows when Knox Capture is being used in the foreground. The device user must grant system permissions for connected devices in order for the prompt to display. If no permissions are granted, the prompt will not display on any screen. #Seamlessly switch between multiple paired devices in Output path If a user is paired with multiple devices in Knox Capture's Output path, they can now switch between each of their paired devices more easily. Previously, if a user had two paired devices in Output path, and Knox Capture was connected to _device A_, the user would first have to disconnect from _device A_ before connecting to _device B_. With this release, the user simply has to connect to _device B_. Knox Capture automatically disconnects from any previously paired devices. #Receive a notification when overlay is restricted by IT admin Some device users may experience an issue where they are unable to view the camera preview window after triggering a scan. This issue can be caused by a restriction set by the IT admin and the organization's UEM policy. Previously, if the restriction was set, the user would simply not be able to see the preview window. In this release, the user will now get a notification asking them to contact their IT admin for more information. To learn more about the restriction, see the Knox Capture Knowledge Base Article (KBA) related to this issue. Back to release notes

Expanded device support In Knox Capture v1.2, support is added for the following devices: Galaxy XCover 4S, Galaxy Tab Active Pro, Galaxy S20, Galaxy S21 Only the keyboard scan icon and floating scan button are supported on non-rugged devices (S20 and S21). For a full list of supported devices, see Supported devices. Keystroke output support in WP-C deployments In previous Knox Capture versions, if an IT admin activated a KPE Premium license with a WP-C deployment, remote injection was blocked in WP-C mode. As a workaround, `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` must be set to True to support keystroke output. With this release, keystroke output in WP-C deployments is supported regardless of whether `AdvancedRestrictionPolicy.allowRemoteControl()` is set to True. Keystroke output support is not yet available for Galaxy S20 devices. You must use the aforementioned workaround to use keystroke output on Galaxy S20 devices. Option to disable default profile IT admins can now enable or disable the default profile. If you create profiles for several applications and don't want the default profile's behavior to override any configurations, set the default profile to Off. The default profile setting is available on the Knox Capture main page. You can change the configuration at any time, export and deploy it to end users in Managed mode. If a profile is not active for an app or foreground activity and the end user attempts to scan a barcode, an error message is shown stating that the application does not support Knox Capture scanning. This setting cannot be changed in Managed mode. New floating button scan trigger !Hardware scan trigger setting !Hardware scan trigger setting A floating scan button is now available that launches the Knox Capture camera for scanning. By default, the scan button appears in the bottom right corner of the device's screen. Users can move it around the screen, and it remains in the last known position until it's toggled off. The scan button can be used in both Admin and Managed modes. See Set camera trigger for more information on the various available triggers. License activation menu for unmanaged devices Previously, Knox Capture licenses could only be used by organizations pushing them through an MDM. Starting from Knox Capture v1.2, IT admins can now activate Knox Capture licenses in-app using the new license activation menu. To deactivate an entered license key, uninstall the Knox Capture app from your device. The license activation menu is only available in Admin mode. For more information, see Activate your license. Support for exporting large configurations through QR code !Multiple QR code export This Knox Capture version extends the QR code export functionality to support larger configurations. Prior to v1.2, IT admins couldn't select QR code as the export method if the configuration size was too large. Now, multiple QR codes are generated in a PDF file for the end user to scan. The device prompts the user to scan them all before the configuration can be successfully imported to Knox Capture. To learn more, see Export a scanning configuration and Import a scanning configuration. Persistent scan sessions IT admins and end users can now pick up calls, switch apps, and clear tasks during scan sessions without losing scanned data. Rebooting the device has no impact on saved scan data. In multi-scan sessions where the user leaves the business app and returns, they are prompted to either continue the original scan session or begin a new one",1129
What policy technology do IT admins use to push the barcode scanning business app profile to enterprise devices?,IT admins push the barcode scanning business app profile to enterprise devices through their Enterprise Mobile Management (EMM) technology.,"
The context mentions that:
""Once the IT admin has configured the profile, they push it to enterprise devices through their EMM (Enterprise Mobility Management).""

So the policy technology IT admins use to push the barcode scanning business app profile to enterprise devices is their EMM or Enterprise Mobility Management system.",1,1,6,1.0,0.9998238682746887,1.0,0,4.209001779556274,". Once the IT admin has configured the profile, they push it to enterprise devices through their EMM. Device users can then start using the business app to scan barcodes.

Why is Knox Capture called a wedge? . A wedge barcode scanner is a physical device that attaches to a keyboard or a computer. It reads barcode data and translates it to a string that is then input into the system, as if a user had manually typed the string using the keyboard. In the same way, Knox Capture acts as middleware that reads barcode data captured by the XCover Pro device, translates it into a string, formats the string, and then sends it to a third-party business app that understands the resulting data. Knox Capture takes care of integrating with your business app, so that you don't have to build barcode scanning logic into your business app using a software development kit (SDK). So how does Knox Capture know which barcodes to read, how to format the data, and which business app to send the data to? The IT admin defines those details in a profile in Knox Capture. Once the IT admin has configured the profile, they push it to enterprise devices through their EMM

. 3. Export profile settings as a configuration file, which can then be used by EMM/UEM administrators to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to end-user devices. #Managed mode After an IT admin uses their EMM/UEM to deploy Knox Capture as a managed app to an end-user's device, the device launches the app in Managed mode. In Managed mode, Knox Capture functionality is greatly reduced. End-users can review their scanning profile settings and perform barcode scans using their business apps (as permitted by their scanning profile), however they can't make changes to their scanning profiles, export profile settings, or switch to Admin mode by activating a Knox Capture license. Admin mode is the default mode of operation for Knox Capture. The procedures described in this guide are targeted at an IT admin audience. Further reading #Getting started tutorials These tutorials provide a guided workflow for new admins and end-users

. When using the default scanning profile, IT admins can change the profile's scan engine settings and data processing rules, however they cannot change the default profile's apps and activities behavior. For example, an IT admin can modify the default profile to append a Tab key at the end of each barcode, but they cannot change which apps can trigger the scanner. Custom scanning profiles While the default scanning profile allows Knox Capture to be used right away without any configuration, IT admins may want to use a custom profile to better suit their needs. With a custom profile, IT admins control which apps and activities can trigger a barcode scan. Any apps that you don't select in the custom profile will follow the default behavior in that the barcode scanner is active for all apps not specified in the custom profile. Creating custom scanning profiles Custom profiles can be created by modifying the default profile settings, or by creating entirely new profiles altogether. 1

Keystroke output data sent to browser or web app instead of business app. Overview Certain company-owned devices with a work profile might encounter an issue where barcode data sent through keystroke output is delivered to a browser or web app instead of the business app. Cause With recent improvements to company-owned devices with a work profile, a change was made to the way web apps - apps delivered through the browser instead of natively on Android - handle text view focus after scanning. On devices running Android 10 and lower, the text view is already in focus when scanned data returns to the business app. This focus behavior is no longer required with company-owned devices with a work profile running Android 11 and higher. Resolution To handle this change, you must enable the Allow remote control policy in your EMM to allow Knox Capture to restore focus to the text view. You only need to enable this policy if you've activated a Knox Platform for Enterprise Premium license.

Scanning profiles. Knox Capture acts as a wedge by translating barcode data into keystrokes that can be sent to a business application. But how does Knox Capture know what barcode types to scan, how to interpret scanned data, and which business applications to pass the data to? For Knox Capture, the *Scanning profile* defines the app's core behavior. A Scanning Profile is a configuration file that gets created or modified by an IT admin using the Knox Capture application. The profile defines how Knox Capture performs a barcode scan, and primarily consists of the following parameters: 1. Apps and activities - define which applications that can launch the Knox Capture scanner. 2. Scanner engine settings - specifying the barcode technologies (QR, Code 128, UPCA, etc.), scanning methods (single barcode, multi barcode), and camera behavior (enable flash, allow camera zoom). 3. Keystroke output rules - specifying how barcode data gets converted into keystrokes (append Tab or Enter character to each barcode, add prefix or suffix characters, convert output to hex characters, etc.) Default scanning profile Out-of-the-box, Knox Capture includes a default scanning profile that gets automatically associated with all apps on the device. In other words, when Knox Capture is launched, *any* app can trigger the camera scanner and receive barcode data in the form of keystrokes. This makes it easy to use Knox Capture for basic scanning purposes without any additional setup. When using the default scanning profile, IT admins can change the profile's scan engine settings and data processing rules, however they cannot change the default profile's apps and activities behavior. For example, an IT admin can modify the default profile to append a Tab key at the end of each barcode, but they cannot change which apps can trigger the scanner. Custom scanning profiles While the default scanning profile allows Knox Capture to be used right away without any configuration, IT admins may want to use a custom profile to better suit their needs. With a custom profile, IT admins control which apps and activities can trigger a barcode scan. Any apps that you don't select in the custom profile will follow the default behavior in that the barcode scanner is active for all apps not specified in the custom profile. Creating custom scanning profiles Custom profiles can be created by modifying the default profile settings, or by creating entirely new profiles altogether. 1. Tap the + button near the top of the app UI to open the profile creation options. 2. Select Create profile to start a profile from scratch, or select Duplicate existing profile to copy the settings from an existing (custom or default) profile. Alternatively, you can create a custom profile by clicking Create profile without clicking the + button. 3. Provide a profile name, then tap Done. The new profile appears in the profiles area below Defult scanning profile.",329
